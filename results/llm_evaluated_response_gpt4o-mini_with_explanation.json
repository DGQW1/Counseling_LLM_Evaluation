Something on your mind? | seeker: I'm concerned about my job. I have been out of work for the past 5 weeks because I tested positive for COVID-19. | supporter: Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? | supporter: Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? | supporter: (sorry for duplication, not sure what happened there!) | seeker: It just keeps getting better... I applied for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and was approved. The next day, I got an email asking me to verify my identity (I am fine with that. It actually makes good sense.)... | supporter: So you have been getting some assistance? | seeker: So I did as instructed and got the message on the website thanking me for verification. The following week I got a physical letter saying I was approved and the award amount per week. | seeker: I have gone online once a week and qualified, as one is supposed to do, and still I have not received a cent. | supporter: I see, so you are really financially struggling at the moment? Is there anywhere else you could apply for assistance? What about a foodbank? | seeker: Calling the customer service line is futile. The computer just plays a recording that the agents are on other calls and then it disconnects the call. | supporter: I hear you there - I spent a long time on hold for an official matter the other day. I guess that everyone is really desperate for help and advice right now. | seeker: I have been very fortunate. People in my church have been bringing me food. I plan on trying to go to the food bank Monday, if they are open. | supporter: I hope that they can help you. My partner and I have used one before and they were very helpful. I felt a bit ashamed but there was no judgement at all. | seeker: I actually got so tired of redialing the Department of Labor and Training that I sent an email to the Lieutenant Governor of the state asking for his assistance in getting the matter resolved. | supporter: That sounds like a very positive thing to have done. I really hope that they pay some attention to you. This situation is not your fault! | seeker: I have been to this food bank once before, and they actually made me feel very comfortable and welcomed and gave me an information package on other ways the parent organization may be able to assist me. | supporter: Yes they are run by lovely people. Ours gave us a pamphlet for cheap and easy to make recipes too. | seeker: I am very lucky in that the organization is only 3 miles from me. I will be looking into their rent assistance and employment assistance programs as well. | supporter: So, at least it sounds like you have a good handle on this and are doing everything you can to help yourself, am I right? | seeker: I have an advantage because I have a professional background in cooking, so I can take random ingredients and turn them into wonderful and nutritious meals. I just need to have the ingredients. | supporter: That sounds very encouraging! It's amazing what you can make even with cheap food. Noodles , for instance, are very versatile :) | seeker: You are right. I am definitely not going to sit and pout. I am just a bit frustrated with the system. | supporter: It's a very strange situation and I suspect that some of the authorities just feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to cope. | seeker: I am concerned that my boss may try to not take me back at my job. Because this is an \"at will\" state, he can terminate me without cause. Although he can not legally fire me for being ill with COVID, he can take me back and simply release me the same day saying that I have become redundant."
