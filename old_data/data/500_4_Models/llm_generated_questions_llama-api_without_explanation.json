I don't know what to do. | supporter: I am sorry to hear that but I am happy to listen and help you if I can | supporter: what sort of things are you trying to decide? | seeker: I don't even know where to start. | seeker: I'm trying to decide if I can build trust with him again. | seeker: He lied about everything. | supporter: Well, let's try to take it one problem at a time so's not to get overwhelmed. What is your biggest problem at the moment? | supporter: Ah, am I to take it that a relationship has recently ended? | seeker: When we met, before we got involved, he said he was divorced. I ended up finding out that he was still legally married. He assured me that they were just a pen's stroke away from being divorced. | seeker: That was in March. | seeker: I found out three weeks ago that they're actually still living together. | seeker: ANd, no. We haven't broken up yet. | supporter: Ah I totally hear you .. the old 'we're getting divorced' line. I've been in that one! You are well out of this. | seeker: I'm debating. I don't know what to do. | seeker: I feel like a schmuck. | seeker: He has such pretty words. | supporter: From personal experience I think that if they say they're going to get divorced and then drag their feet it is never going to happen. | seeker: And he invests so much time and effort into us. | seeker: I agree with you. | seeker: My mind agrees. | seeker: My stupid emotions are clouding things. | supporter: Well, if you were to give him an ultimatum what do you think he would say? | seeker: I did. | seeker: LOL | supporter: And he's still married? | seeker: And he brought his kids to my house so they could meet my kids. He had a conversation with them about why he and their mother had been living the way they had. (in seperate floors of the house) | seeker: That was two weeks ago. | seeker: So, yes, he is. | seeker: Too soon to tell. | supporter: I can tell that you feel that you are being cheated here. I can't tell you what to do but don't you think you deserve better? | seeker: I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out. Should I give him time to prove himself now that he's backed into a corner. | supporter: It's not for me to say but I wonder if he's really going to change as he has not already. | seeker: That's not an easy question to answer. He treats me very well. Always has. And he is frantically trying to accomodate me, now htat I know. | seeker: I agree with you. It's one of my fears. | supporter: How do your children feel about this? And his? | seeker: MY children (6 and 9) have been living with him in their lives as a male figure who is growing into a father figure. He and I have been together for fifteen months, and part-time living together for six. | seeker: This isn't a new relationship. That's part of the complication, too. | seeker: His kids actually asked if they could come live with me while he and his (ex?) figured their shit out. | supporter: Yes, I can imagine that it is. It is always really difficult when children are involved. I know you would not want your children to be hurt | seeker: It's a messed up situation that COVID has not improved. He was furloughed in May. | seeker: Indeed I don't, you're right. | supporter: I hear you. Covid has disrupted the whole world so might this year! I can't wait for it to be over. | seeker: But now it seems like it will hurt them if I break up with him. | supporter: But it will hurt them more the longer the situation goes on :( | seeker: I wish I could say that I were confident that 2021 would be better, but... | seeker: Too right. | seeker: And this is all a part of why this is not a simple situation. | supporter: Well it surely could not be worse :) | seeker: I have no doubt that he loves me very much. | seeker: Hahahaha! Seems that way. | seeker: He didn't make this lie up for me. That's an interesting thing. | seeker: He was living the \"divorced dad\" lie to A LOT of people. | seeker: Anybody and everybody who was far enough away to be lied to. | seeker: She lives in her bedroom. Only comes out to work two nights a week. DOesn't want to have anything to do with her kids (5, 9, 11, 13) | supporter: (sorry was afk let me catch up) | seeker: And she and my BF have been living that way for three years. Over a year before I even met him. | supporter: Is it possible she is suffering from depression? | seeker: I would all but guarantee it. | supporter: It just worries me that he might treat you the same way if you were ever in the same position | seeker: Here's the other kicker, though... | seeker: She knows about me. | seeker: (I know. You're right. I thought that as well)\n\nWhat would be an appropriate counseling question to ask?\n\nCounseling Question:",

Thus your machine then knows how you write out words in particular and how to translate those words from steno to English - each stenographer writes a little differently. | supporter: OK that makes sense, so you basically program it as the user. I take it your stenography machine becomes pretty close to you lol | supporter: Is this your first holiday alone? | seeker: Yes, exactly! And it's very important to back up your personal dictionary to the cloud or a seperate drive so that you don't lose it in a hard-drive crash. A lot of work goes into creating that dictionary! No, it's happened before, being along for the holidays; but you've helped to cheer me up, so thanks! | supporter: No problem, I hope I have made your day a little better! | seeker: You have, thanks! Did you do anything special? | supporter: Have a good rest of this year and don't forget to make your New Year's resolution! | seeker: I will do that - you too.

I'm sure I'm not the only one with no plans this weekend, though. | supporter: True but I can understand that, it is hard being alone at the holidays. | supporter: Did you have plans this weekend? | seeker: No. My nearby friends all went away for the holidays. I could probably just occupy my time with things I need or want to do in order to distract myself. | supporter: What kind of hobbies do you have? | seeker: I'm teaching myself the piano.

It started christmas eve raining a ton here but it got to 15F over the night so it turned to a pretty heavy snow. | seeker: They are, helped take my mind off of the stuff I wass stresing over | supporter: Well, there are incense pots that allow you to close you eyes and feel the glow of the meditation sticks. Certain scents can release stress. Do you have any on the home that you can burn? | seeker: I do have some incense sticks, I usually use palo santo sticks though | supporter: I have heard good things about Palo Santo sticks and rosemary / lavender oils that can calm and relax, | seeker: I think I have some rosemary essential oil actually | supporter: Do you have any music or sound effects that you can listen to as to be able to relax? | seeker: I do, have some music on currently | seeker: I love music, I'm almost always listening to something lol | supporter: I suggest rosemary oils all the time. Getting a few quaffs can calm the nerves. | supporter: Listening to calming sound effects like running creek water in the woods or dolphins communicating could put you in a good mood. | supporter: They say its best to stop those racing thoughts and breath in a steady pace. | seeker: I will definitely try out the roemary oil\n\nWhat would be an appropriate counseling question to ask?\n\nCounseling Question:",

It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school. | supporter: Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty.

Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments. | seeker: Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break | seeker: I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe. | supporter: Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books. | supporter: Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down.

There is a ton of stress on both ends. | supporter: Which do you and your man like to communicate? | seeker: No live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person. | seeker: I communicate much more than he does. Thats why I think he is hiding something. | supporter: Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot. | seeker: You are right. I will try to be more sensitive about that. Thank you for your help. | supporter: I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you. | seeker: Do you think getting other people involved is a good idea? | supporter: I would be subtle about that tactic. | supporter: If you haven't met any of his school mates. I wouldn't pursue that option. Have you met any of his class mates? | seeker: Yeah he has a few close friends but he is pretty to himself. We both live far away from home. | supporter: Are you and him directly off campuses in housing? You both attend the same college, correct? | seeker: Yes off campus. Same college. | supporter: Where do you work? Have you seen the customer who said that your partner was cheating?"

I was so embarrassed. I did not eat for days.\n\nConversation History:\nseeker: Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. | supporter: Cheating on you? | seeker: Yes. | seeker: With another woman. | supporter: How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? | supporter: Did he tell you that he is? | seeker: I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. | seeker: He will not admit it himself. | supporter: I am sorry if your partner is cheating. | supporter: So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? | supporter: Are you and your partner married? | seeker: Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. | seeker: We are not married but we live together. | supporter: How long have you been in a relationship with your man? | seeker: 2 years | supporter: So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. | seeker: What do you mean exactly? | supporter: Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. | seeker: I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. | supporter: Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. | seeker: That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. | supporter: I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. | seeker: Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous? | supporter: Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. | seeker: That is a good point. | supporter: Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. | supporter: Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. | seeker: I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. | seeker: But I appreciate your suggestions | seeker: and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile | supporter: Sure, I understand. | seeker: I should trust my partner more than any random person. | supporter: Yes, the workplace is not like home life. | supporter: Yes, trust matters. | seeker: But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? | supporter: I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you....even after work. | seeker: okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. | supporter: Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. | supporter: Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. | seeker: That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. | supporter: You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. | supporter: How old are the both of you? | seeker: Okay. I will keep that in mind. | seeker: We are 22. | supporter: Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? | seeker: Yes but less over the past few months. | supporter: Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. | supporter: I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related....for him. | supporter: Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. | supporter: You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. | seeker: That's understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. | supporter: How do you all generally communicate? Through text? | seeker: He is going to law school and I am going to med school.
