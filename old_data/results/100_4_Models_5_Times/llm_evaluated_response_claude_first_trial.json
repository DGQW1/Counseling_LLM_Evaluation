I think that most men would fess up about it. | seeker: I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. | supporter: Does he show affection to you?

Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. | supporter: Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. | supporter: Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. | seeker: That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. | supporter: You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. | supporter: How old are the both of you? | seeker: Okay. I will keep that in mind. | seeker: We are 22. | supporter: Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? | seeker: Yes but less over the past few months. | supporter: Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. | supporter: I mean, the love life.

I'm sure I'm not the only one with no plans this weekend, though. | supporter: True but I can understand that, it is hard being alone at the holidays. | supporter: Did you have plans this weekend? | seeker: No. My nearby friends all went away for the holidays. I could probably just occupy my time with things I need or want to do in order to distract myself. | supporter: What kind of hobbies do you have? | seeker: I'm teaching myself the piano. I'm also teaching myself how to work a stenography machine for possible future employment as a stenographer. I also like to read novels. | supporter: I have never understood how those work..I find it amazing someone can type out whole words or sentences with one word | seeker: Yeah, it's pretty cool. For example, if I hit DRAT in one stroke, then \"Did there come a time\" will appear in English on my machine's LCD screen. | supporter: Wow that is crazy, I don't understand how that works, is it preprogrammed or does it go by how the word sounds? | seeker: Each stenographer has their own \"Personal Dictionary\" which is a list of words in English along with how you in particular write out those words or phrases in steno. This dictionary is present within the actual steno machine after you transfer it from your laptop to the machine via cable or wifi. Thus your machine then knows how you write out words in particular and how to translate those words from steno to English - each stenographer writes a little differently. | supporter: OK that makes sense, so you basically program it as the user. I take it your stenography machine becomes pretty close to you lol | supporter: Is this your first holiday alone? | seeker: Yes, exactly! And it's very important to back up your personal dictionary to the cloud or a seperate drive so that you don't lose it in a hard-drive crash. A lot of work goes into creating that dictionary! No, it's happened before, being along for the holidays; but you've helped to cheer me up, so thanks! | supporter: No problem, I hope I have made your day a little better! | seeker: You have, thanks! Did you do anything special? | supporter: Have a good rest of this year and don't forget to make your New Year's resolution! | seeker: I will do that - you too. Thanks, again... | supporter: Not really, stayed home lol... Have a good one! | seeker: You too... bye now... | supporter: Good day!"

My partner is cheating on me. | supporter: Cheating on you? | seeker: Yes. | seeker: With another woman. | supporter: How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? | supporter: Did he tell you that he is? | seeker: I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. | seeker: He will not admit it himself. | supporter: I am sorry if your partner is cheating. | supporter: So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? | supporter: Are you and your partner married? | seeker: Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. | seeker: We are not married but we live together. | supporter: How long have you been in a relationship with your man? | seeker: 2 years | supporter: So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. | seeker: What do you mean exactly? | supporter: Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. | seeker: I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. | supporter: Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. | seeker: That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. | supporter: I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. | seeker: Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous? | supporter: Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. | seeker: That is a good point. | supporter: Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. | supporter: Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. | seeker: I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. | seeker: But I appreciate your suggestions | seeker: and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile | supporter: Sure, I understand. | seeker: I should trust my partner more than any random person. | supporter: Yes, the workplace is not like home life. | supporter: Yes, trust matters. | seeker: But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? | supporter: I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you....even after work. | seeker: okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. | supporter: Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. | supporter: Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. | seeker: That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. | supporter: You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. | supporter: How old are the both of you? | seeker: Okay. I will keep that in mind. | seeker: We are 22. | supporter: Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? | seeker: Yes but less over the past few months. | supporter: Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. | supporter: I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related....for him. | supporter: Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. | supporter: You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. | seeker: That's understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. | supporter: How do you all generally communicate? Through text? | seeker: He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends. | supporter: Which do you and your man like to communicate? | seeker: No live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person. | seeker: I communicate much more than he does. Thats why I think he is hiding something. | supporter: Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot. | seeker: You are right. I will try to be more sensitive about that. Thank you for your help. | supporter: I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you. | seeker: Do you think getting other people involved is a good idea? | supporter: I would be subtle about that tactic. | supporter: If you haven't met any of his school mates. I wouldn't pursue that option. Have you met any of his class mates? | seeker: Yeah he has a few close friends but he is pretty to himself. We both live far away from home. | supporter: Are you and him directly off campuses in housing? You both attend the same college, correct? | seeker: Yes off campus. Same college. | supporter: Where do you work? Have you seen the customer who said that your partner was cheating?"

I made friends with like-minded people who volunteered to make a difference. | seeker: I actually think that is a great idea. I have never thought of doing that for that specific purpose. | supporter: Groups like Habitat for Humanity or UNICEF will help you to build long-lasting friendships. | supporter: It just takes finding the right volunteer groups and being willing to be pro-active. | seeker: I guess it makes a lot of sense. If you go to a party or a bar, you don't know what you will get, as it is a mixed bag of personalities. Whereas if you go to something like what you suggested then you already know that the people you meet have the same kind of heart. | supporter: You can do it. I have faith that you can use volunteering as the right method. | seeker: Thank you for that suggestion, that is really helpful and something that I will take with me from now on. | supporter: Exactly, volunteering is a great option. And there are many organizations to join. | supporter: Did you need help with anything else? | seeker: I feel ok being alone mostly, but other times I would like to have people I could relate with and hang out with. Probably has a lot to do with ADHD and how I feel misunderstood or my anxiety gets the best of me in social situations | supporter: I understand the ADHD. There are support groups that can help you make friends; especially with ADHD, etc. | seeker: do you know any specific groups? | supporter: Using tools to build houses helps to release endorphins, which can release anxiety. | seeker: is this something you have done? | supporter: There is a group called, \"Harry House\" that provides support to those with ADHD and anxiety. | seeker: oh ok!

It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me. | supporter: Wow, that's horrible. How do you feel about it? | seeker: I feel lost. I'm so used to her being around everyday. Now I don't know what to do with myself without her. | supporter: I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. | supporter: That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year | seeker: Not only that, but with Covid going on I have noone i can see to talk about it. | supporter: Do you have any family? | seeker: Yes, i do, but they are far away. | supporter: Friends closeby? | supporter: Hobbies? | supporter: What kind of work do you do? | seeker: I do have friends, who are also friends with her. However they have families and do not visit prople because of covid. | seeker: I don't have any true hobbies. I don't think they will fill the void anyways. | supporter: Well you know, I have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow. | seeker: I do software development, but its a work at home situation. So i have been just by myself for the last week, and its driving me crazy. All i do is think about why she would do that. | seeker: I've had time to myself but its not getting any better. | supporter: I have always tried to think of things in a positive way. This way even when something really bad happens, it doesn't seem so bad as to overwhelm us from recovering. | seeker: What positive are there here?"

One sided relationships do not work. | seeker: yes it wont work at all | supporter: What else besides unhappy do you feel about this breakup? Often there are a mix of emotions and looking at all of them is important to see the whole picture. People often report feeling relieved, regretful or other emotions with the feeling of unhappy. | seeker: there is only thing for my depression is my break up i want to over come but i couldnot . | supporter: What are some things that you enjoyed doing before this relationship? | seeker: i was going out for night pub ,enjoying with friends | supporter: Reaching out to old friends is a great idea to be able to regain some joy in life. | seeker: but i cannot face them in this sutiation | supporter: Many books have suggested that we are allowed to disclose what we want in relationships with friends. So if it is not something you wish to talk about with your friends tell them that and they should be willing to accept it. However I do understand if you do not want to reconnect with friends. | seeker: they will accept me but i am not willing to share my negative mood with them."

It's a gig job, much like mturk, but the company is dropping people from my state on that date. | supporter: I know its tough especially with the holidays and all. You have so many great skills and are such a hard worker I dont think you will have a problem at all finding something different. | seeker: I've been looking at other companies, but learning a new system after all these years is difficult. | supporter: I remember a time I lost my job and felt my whole world crumbling but then I realized when one door closes another door opens. when those doors close it seems that its usually for the best because it opens the path for something bigger and greater for you. | seeker: That's true. I've thought about looking into new fields. | supporter: Have you looked into some evening classes or maybe online schooling? I hear there are so many different options when it comes to online learning. | seeker: I was looking into that last night, but with covid, classes have had to cut enrollment and are already full for next semester. | supporter: They are full? well what about surrounding towns? Have you sat down and really thought about your passions and what you enjoy doing? Maybe theres an elderly person who needs some companionship or something like that in town for the time being. | seeker: I don't have a car, so I'm stuck doing classes locally.

I made friends with like-minded people who volunteered to make a difference. | seeker: I actually think that is a great idea. I have never thought of doing that for that specific purpose. | supporter: Groups like Habitat for Humanity or UNICEF will help you to build long-lasting friendships. | supporter: It just takes finding the right volunteer groups and being willing to be pro-active. | seeker: I guess it makes a lot of sense. If you go to a party or a bar, you don't know what you will get, as it is a mixed bag of personalities. Whereas if you go to something like what you suggested then you already know that the people you meet have the same kind of heart. | supporter: You can do it. I have faith that you can use volunteering as the right method. | seeker: Thank you for that suggestion, that is really helpful and something that I will take with me from now on. | supporter: Exactly, volunteering is a great option. And there are many organizations to join. | supporter: Did you need help with anything else? | seeker: I feel ok being alone mostly, but other times I would like to have people I could relate with and hang out with. Probably has a lot to do with ADHD and how I feel misunderstood or my anxiety gets the best of me in social situations | supporter: I understand the ADHD. There are support groups that can help you make friends; especially with ADHD, etc. | seeker: do you know any specific groups? | supporter: Using tools to build houses helps to release endorphins, which can release anxiety. | seeker: is this something you have done? | supporter: There is a group called, \"Harry House\" that provides support to those with ADHD and anxiety. | seeker: oh ok! I will certainly look that up, thank you for that information. | supporter: Surely. Is there anything else you need help with? | seeker: Does one have to travel far to participate in building houses? | supporter: No, Habitat fir Humanity has car pools. | seeker: do you know if it requires a person to be away from home a long time? | supporter: They are a good group to help you build meaningful relationships. | supporter: I used to do a hour at a time; maybe one or twice a week. | seeker: oh! so a person could just choose how often and how long they participate? | supporter: Would you be interested in something like HFH? | seeker: thank you for sharing with me, i might like to participate in it in the future | supporter: Yes, you can sign up online to join a project. | seeker: ok i will look that up, thank you for all your help | supporter: Yes, you can volunteer locally; HFH is nationwide. | seeker: ok thank you"
