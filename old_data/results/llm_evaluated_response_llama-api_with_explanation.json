Something on your mind? | seeker: I'm concerned about my job. I have been out of work for the past 5 weeks because I tested positive for COVID-19. | supporter: Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? | supporter: Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? | supporter: (sorry for duplication, not sure what happened there!) | seeker: It just keeps getting better... I applied for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and was approved. The next day, I got an email asking me to verify my identity (I am fine with that. It actually makes good sense.)... | supporter: So you have been getting some assistance? | seeker: So I did as instructed and got the message on the website thanking me for verification. The following week I got a physical letter saying I was approved and the award amount per week. | seeker: I have gone online once a week and qualified, as one is supposed to do, and still I have not received a cent. | supporter: I see, so you are really financially struggling at the moment? Is there anywhere else you could apply for assistance? What about a foodbank? | seeker: Calling the customer service line is futile. The computer just plays a recording that the agents are on other calls and then it disconnects the call. | supporter: I hear you there - I spent a long time on hold for an official matter the other day. I guess that everyone is really desperate for help and advice right now. | seeker: I have been very fortunate. People in my church have been bringing me food. I plan on trying to go to the food bank Monday, if they are open. | supporter: I hope that they can help you. My partner and I have used one before and they were very helpful. I felt a bit ashamed but there was no judgement at all. | seeker: I actually got so tired of redialing the Department of Labor and Training that I sent an email to the Lieutenant Governor of the state asking for his assistance in getting the matter resolved. | supporter: That sounds like a very positive thing to have done. I really hope that they pay some attention to you. This situation is not your fault! | seeker: I have been to this food bank once before, and they actually made me feel very comfortable and welcomed and gave me an information package on other ways the parent organization may be able to assist me. | supporter: Yes they are run by lovely people. Ours gave us a pamphlet for cheap and easy to make recipes too. | seeker: I am very lucky in that the organization is only 3 miles from me. I will be looking into their rent assistance and employment assistance programs as well. | supporter: So, at least it sounds like you have a good handle on this and are doing everything you can to help yourself, am I right? | seeker: I have an advantage because I have a professional background in cooking, so I can take random ingredients and turn them into wonderful and nutritious meals. I just need to have the ingredients. | supporter: That sounds very encouraging! It's amazing what you can make even with cheap food. Noodles , for instance, are very versatile :) | seeker: You are right. I am definitely not going to sit and pout. I am just a bit frustrated with the system. | supporter: It's a very strange situation and I suspect that some of the authorities just feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to cope. | seeker: I am concerned that my boss may try to not take me back at my job. Because this is an \"at will\" state, he can terminate me without cause. Although he can not legally fire me for being ill with COVID, he can take me back and simply release me the same day saying that I have become redundant."

Have you been worrying about anything? | seeker: I have been staying home since last March due to COVID; getting very depressed. | supporter: Ah I hear you, I have been self isolating too. Do you have an online support network? | seeker: What do you mean by support netwrok? | supporter: Well, friends you can talk to during this difficult time? I have a lot of friends on facebook and similar that I can talk to. | seeker: I have few friends and can talk to but not sure how would they help. | supporter: Sometimes it does just make it easier to know that other people are in the same situation as you :) | seeker: You mean share experiences among the friends? | supporter: Yes .. or at least share coping mechanisms perhaps? | supporter: Do you have any hobbies that you can occupy yourself with right now? | seeker: Yes, I pay musical instruments but do to COVID could not play with the band"
    },
    "original_question": "Questions: How did playing with the band usually make you feel, and do you think not playing with them is contributing to your feelings of depression?\nExplanation: I ask this question because the seeker mentioned that they used to play with a band, implying that it was an important part of their life and possibly a source of joy and social connection. By exploring how playing with the band made them feel, I can help the seeker identify what they are missing and how it may be impacting their mental health. Additionally, this question can help me understand whether the lack of social interaction and creative expression is contributing to their depression, and potentially explore ways to adapt or replace this activity during the COVID pandemic.",

I'm feeling a bit down because I'm alone for the holidays. | supporter: Well that's no good, does your family live far away? | seeker: Yes, my family is scattered all over the country, like Seattle, Georgia, PA. I'm sure I'm not the only one with no plans this weekend, though. | supporter: True but I can understand that, it is hard being alone at the holidays. | supporter: Did you have plans this weekend? | seeker: No. My nearby friends all went away for the holidays. I could probably just occupy my time with things I need or want to do in order to distract myself. | supporter: What kind of hobbies do you have? | seeker: I'm teaching myself the piano. I'm also teaching myself how to work a stenography machine for possible future employment as a stenographer. I also like to read novels. | supporter: I have never understood how those work..I find it amazing someone can type out whole words or sentences with one word | seeker: Yeah, it's pretty cool. For example, if I hit DRAT in one stroke, then \"Did there come a time\" will appear in English on my machine's LCD screen. | supporter: Wow that is crazy, I don't understand how that works, is it preprogrammed or does it go by how the word sounds? | seeker: Each stenographer has their own \"Personal Dictionary\" which is a list of words in English along with how you in particular write out those words or phrases in steno. This dictionary is present within the actual steno machine after you transfer it from your laptop to the machine via cable or wifi. Thus your machine then knows how you write out words in particular and how to translate those words from steno to English - each stenographer writes a little differently. | supporter: OK that makes sense, so you basically program it as the user. I take it your stenography machine becomes pretty close to you lol"

    "original_question": "Questions: How do you think engaging in your hobbies like playing the piano or practicing stenography could help you cope with the feeling of loneliness this weekend, and are there any other activities or connections you'd like to explore to make the time more enjoyable?\nExplanation: I ask this question to help the seeker reflect on how their existing hobbies and interests can be a source of comfort and distraction during a lonely period. By exploring ways to engage with their hobbies, we can identify potential coping strategies and ways to make the weekend more fulfilling. Additionally, by inquiring about other activities or connections, we can begin to brainstorm ideas for expanding their social circle or finding new ways to meet people, which may help alleviate feelings of loneliness in the long run.",

By asking an open-ended question, I'm inviting the seeker to share their concerns and feelings, and expressing my willingness to listen and support them.

By asking this question, I'm helping the seeker consider whether a similar approach might work for them, while also encouraging them to think about their own feelings and needs in the situation.

However, it's also important to address the emotional impact of job loss, especially during a pandemic. By asking about self-care and support systems, I can help the client explore their emotional well-being, identify potential coping mechanisms, and connect them with resources that can provide emotional support.

Can you tell me what’s going on? | seeker: My ex partner and I broke up a long time ago because they cheated on me. Now they will not stop contacting my friends and family and posting about me on social media | supporter: That sounds difficult and stressful. What do you do when you see it happening? | seeker: I usually just document it and try to not go online for a while. It is hard to ignore | supporter: It sounds like you are avoiding things you enjoy because of their actions. I think documenting it is a good idea! Have you tried reporting them for harassing you? | seeker: I have tried but everyone just tells me there is nothing they can do because they don't think it is dangerous or criminal at this point | supporter: That must be very frustrating. Can you tell me if you’ve tried other things to get them to stop? | seeker: I have confronted them in person but it was dramatic to say the least. They basically had a meltdown that they don't want to lose me | supporter: You tried to do the right thing and they are having a difficult time letting go. The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, I had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, I asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and I realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter. Would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions? | seeker: I have encouraged my friends to block them as well, but a new account always pops up. My ex really will not give up."

I know how bad it can feel when life throws you a curve-ball. Can you tell me about your situation? | seeker: my girlfriend was break up with me two days ago | supporter: Oh dear. That is a very upsetting situation. It sounds like you might be feeling lonely and rejected as a result of your girlfriend breaking up with you. Is that right? | seeker: yeah! we were in a relationship for three years, and suddenly she broke up with me | supporter: That's a long time. I was in a similar situation not too long ago and I understand how hard this must be for you. | seeker: I taught that she was my everything hereafter. | seeker: but the fate plays a great game upon me | supporter: During a time like this, some people find it helpful to keep busy doing some kind of activity to take their mind off of their pain. Is there something you can do to take your mind off of it until you're ready to manage your feelings? | seeker: I have some activities to do so, but i cannot able to concentrate on what i am doing | supporter: Okay, that's very understandable. I'm sure there's another strategy we can come up with. | supporter: Do you have a friend or family member you can talk about your feelings with? | seeker: yeah! i have few friends | supporter: That's great. You've already taken a huge step by reaching out for help and that's a big deal! A good next step might be letting the people around you know that you need some support at this time. Sometimes people don't know something until you tell them, even if it seems obvious. Is that something you can do? | seeker: But i can't tell this to them because they also become sad when they know about this | supporter: Okay, I understand. Do you feel embarrassed because this is happening to you? | seeker: yes i am | seeker: and i don't know how to overcome from this kind of sadness | supporter: I understand that your feelings of sadness run very deep. Do you have people in your life who you can safely spend time with without necessarily talking about your feelings? Feeling connected to people can help quite a lot. | seeker: yes i have someone | seeker: who is my well wisher | supporter: It's great that you have someone who can give you positivity and support. Do you feel comfortable with trying that or would you like to explore other options? | seeker: but, what can i do with them in this situation | seeker: do you have any idea? | supporter: It might be helpful to simply spend some time together. Connecting with someone who cares about you can help reassure your positive feelings in yourself. | seeker: ohhh...I understand | supporter: If you feel able to, something outdoors might be good. Fresh air and physical activity can help lower anxiety and doing a mutual activity can help strengthen bonds between people. | seeker: shall i try gym workouts? is that work for me to overcome? | supporter: Yes, that's a great idea! It sounds like you're already better at this than you think. | seeker: The Idea came up to me just now | supporter: Fantastic. I hope this strategy works for you and helps you feel better. | seeker: yeah! i think so, and i don't have to tell this to anyone | supporter: Exactly! You don't have to do anything that you're not comfortable with. | seeker: yes, I need to be strong on my emotions"

I had to walk away. Has your friend asked you why you are ignoring him?

By inquiring about their feelings when they discovered the reason for the breakup, we can gain insight into their emotional response and potential areas of distress, such as shock, betrayal, or sadness.

This can also help to identify any potential patterns or triggers that may be contributing to their distress, such as feelings of low self-worth or a need for control.

By exploring his feelings about this dynamic, I aim to help him understand whether his sense of emptiness is related to the loss of this intense physical connection or if there were other emotional needs that weren't being met in the relationship.

Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well. | seeker: Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough. | supporter: I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now? | seeker: I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot | supporter: Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that. | supporter: For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. | supporter: I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much. | seeker: Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? | seeker: I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating. | supporter: Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule. | seeker: Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school. | supporter: Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. | supporter: Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments. | seeker: Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break | seeker: I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe. | supporter: Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books. | supporter: Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing."

Given their upcoming job loss, it's essential to address how these habits may need to change to ensure their family's financial well-being. This question encourages the seeker to think critically about their financial situation and consider making adjustments to cope with the new reality. By exploring this topic, we can begin to discuss potential strategies for reducing expenses and developing a more sustainable financial plan.",

Or perhaps time? | seeker: I just don't know. I am going to try my best to submit every assignment on time, even though the quality prolly won't be 100%. | seeker: I am a perfectionist by nature. | seeker: I am a bit moody and my roommates have noticed it. | supporter: It's okto be moody given the circumstances and the stress you are going through, and I think that you should attemp to complete all the assignments even if you don't get a 100% on them. | supporter: That will show the professors that you are responsible and care about the subject or perhaps your major. | seeker: I think that I need to research more to ace this out. | supporter: Accomplishing to submit everything will also make you feel good with yourself! | supporter: It's important than you take your time. | seeker: Most so-called professors are snobs and their TA's are worse. | seeker: Academia is full of lazy admins and lame teachers. Plus, the student loan costs are atrocious. | supporter: I understand that college can be financially demanding. | seeker: It is a rip off for what you get..... | seeker: Hopefully, my student loans will be forgiven by President Joe Biden in 2021 | seeker: My anxiety is from the costs of college as well. | supporter: You need to think that you will have a secure job once you graduate, and every debt will be eventually paid off even if Biden doesn't forgive it. | supporter: Try to remain optimistic and shake away the anxiety, it won't do you any good. | seeker: Yeah, but big debts are big debts"

    "original_question": "Questions: How do you think your family and roommates can best support you during this stressful time, and are there any specific things they could do to help you feel more calm and focused?\nExplanation: I ask this question because the seeker mentioned that their family and roommates have noticed their moody behavior, and it's likely that they are concerned about the seeker's well-being. By asking how they can best support the seeker, I can help the seeker think about ways to communicate their needs to their loved ones and potentially get the support they need to manage their stress and anxiety. Additionally, this question can help the seeker feel more connected to their support system and less alone in their struggles.",

You have every right to feel angry. | seeker: Some friends to gossip....yeah, I am disgusted for sure, | seeker: We had been together over 2 years.... | supporter: Unfortunately there are people out there who are not true friends and who just want something to talk about. I have experienced that myself. | seeker: Yeah, I bet many have. It is not a very Civil society. | seeker: Very uncivil method of breaking up.... | supporter: It really is not is it! I can tell how upset you feel just from talking to you, and also that the method of the break up is really sore point. | seeker: It just disgusts me how gauche my girl's method was. Maybe people should be more polite about how they communicate about something like breaking up. | supporter: It could be that you are better off without her? If she has such bad manners then I think that you cn do better. | seeker: That is a great point. A rather gauche move on her part, dontcha think? | seeker: Have you ever had someone dump you?? | supporter: Yes I do. I would not personally do that to someone even if I was unhappy in relationship. | seeker: Yeah, I hear you. | supporter: Yes I have been dumped. We had been together for eight years and he left me for another woman. | seeker: I feel disgusted so much that I got played \"like an old fiddle.\" It sucks..... | supporter: I know how you are feeling but I think that you need to get professional help to move on. Are you able to go to therapy? | seeker: I haven't thought about getting therapy. What would help? | supporter: Well, I think it could be really beneficial to let your anger out | seeker: I am glad to be able to vent to you about my girl's actions. I hope she is not going to hook up with my \"wing man,' Rick. I would be filled with even more disgust."

By asking about the circumstances of discovery and their subsequent self-care, I can better understand their emotional state, assess their coping mechanisms, and provide more targeted support.

    "original_question": "Questions: How are you feeling about the lack of intimacy and the distance in your relationship over the past few months, and do you think it's related to the allegations of cheating or something else entirely?\nExplanation: I ask this question to explore the seeker's emotions and thoughts about the current state of their relationship, particularly the decrease in intimacy, and to understand whether they believe it's connected to the cheating allegations or if there might be other factors at play, such as stress or physical issues, as previously mentioned. This can help to further understand their concerns and feelings, and to guide the conversation towards potential underlying issues that need to be addressed.",

He says the person who told me is lying. | seeker: We are not married but we live together. | supporter: How long have you been in a relationship with your man? | seeker: 2 years | supporter: So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. | seeker: What do you mean exactly? | supporter: Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. | seeker: I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. | supporter: Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. | seeker: That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. | supporter: I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. | seeker: Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous? | supporter: Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. | seeker: That is a good point. | supporter: Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. | supporter: Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. | seeker: I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. | seeker: But I appreciate your suggestions | seeker: and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile | supporter: Sure, I understand. | seeker: I should trust my partner more than any random person. | supporter: Yes, the workplace is not like home life. | supporter: Yes, trust matters. | seeker: But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject.

I want to explore how this stress may be impacting their relationship and communication, and whether they have been able to work together to manage their stress and support each other.

      "context": "seeker: Hello, I'm feeling a lot of anxiety. | supporter: I am sorry to hear that. Do you know what may be causing ytour anxiety? | seeker: I found out I'm losing my job on January 1. | supporter: You lost your job? thats a tough situation. Is it due to covid? | seeker: No, not due to covid. It's a gig job, much like mturk, but the company is dropping people from my state on that date. | supporter: I know its tough especially with the holidays and all. You have so many great skills and are such a hard worker I dont think you will have a problem at all finding something different. | seeker: I've been looking at other companies, but learning a new system after all these years is difficult. | supporter: I remember a time I lost my job and felt my whole world crumbling but then I realized when one door closes another door opens. when those doors close it seems that its usually for the best because it opens the path for something bigger and greater for you. | seeker: That's true. I've thought about looking into new fields. | supporter: Have you looked into some evening classes or maybe online schooling? I hear there are so many different options when it comes to online learning. | seeker: I was looking into that last night, but with covid, classes have had to cut enrollment and are already full for next semester. | supporter: They are full? well what about surrounding towns? Have you sat down and really thought about your passions and what you enjoy doing? Maybe theres an elderly person who needs some companionship or something like that in town for the time being. | seeker: I don't have a car, so I'm stuck doing classes locally. I think I'll just have to wait for the next semester."

    "original_question": "Questions: How are you taking care of yourself during this challenging time, and what kinds of things have you been doing to manage your anxiety about your job loss and the upcoming holidays?\nExplanation: I ask this question because the client is experiencing anxiety and uncertainty about their future, and it's essential to assess their self-care and coping mechanisms. By exploring how they are managing their anxiety, I can understand their current emotional state and identify potential areas where they may need additional support or guidance. Additionally, asking about self-care can help shift the focus from the external circumstances (job loss, pandemic, holidays) to the client's internal experience and empower them to take care of themselves during this difficult time.",

This inconsistency suggests that they are struggling with something and are possibly hesitant to open up about it. By asking a gentle and non-judgmental question, I'm encouraging them to share their concerns and feelings, and providing a safe space for them to express themselves. This question also helps to explore the underlying cause of their upset, which in this case, is related to the person who ghosted them after an argument, as mentioned in the client situation.",

This suggests that there may be underlying issues that are not being addressed. By asking about the seeker's past experiences, particularly the significant life events of losing a job and going to prison, I can help them explore potential connections between those events and their current emotional state, and begin to understand the root causes of their feelings.

It's just one test at the end of the day, you can do this! | seeker: Yes I am not super worried about it it is more the stress from not having free time, also insurance textbooks are not extremely exciting. | supporter: I know that I told you to try to fit school time into your schedule, but the same goes with leisure time for yourself. Find an activity that you enjoy and try to dedicate at least an hour a day to it, be it exercising, playing videogames, reading a book. | seeker: Yes that is good advice, I try to find time for myself but time seems to disappear sometimes | supporter: Happens to all of us. I myself sometimes get too invested in work and the days go by without me realizing it, but it should definetely be a priority.

Sometimes that can happen when you look back on yourself. | supporter: What is making you angry about the past? | seeker: I am angry I trusted my ex partner. They cheated on me and tried to hide it for months. | supporter: I can personally relate to that myself. I have went through something similar like that 4 years ago. It can be very frustrating when it happens. | seeker: What do you do when you are reminded of that situation or think about the person? | supporter: The easiest thing that I did in my situation was obtained a new hobby. I took my anger out on my ex by joining Crossfit and interacted with that community. It helped me take my mind of from my ex. | seeker: I've seen that Crossfit helps a lot of people. That is a good idea but it is kind of intimidating | supporter: Crossfit may not be for everyone, but do you think a new hobby may help you? Have you taken one in recently? | seeker: I have recently started painting and it is very relaxing | supporter: Painting is an excellent hobby. I can see that it's relaxing as well as help put your emotions into something physical. | seeker: Yes. I usually do it while listening to podcasts. It is a great distraction | supporter: It sounds like that you are doing great with your hobby. Have you try to interact with anyone else, such as an art community or your friends on your feedback? | seeker: I have but not many of my friends have been in the position I was or understand how I feel | supporter: Yea, I can see why that may make you feel alone in that aspect. I thought about that myself, but there are groups that can help you out. Strangers in fact. I went on Reddit to express my frustrations and it can help to just let out your anger. | seeker: Personally I've heard that Reddit can be really toxic | supporter: It can be, but seeing several posts in their groups, most offer advice or at least sympathy. It is kind of like what we are doing right now to be honest. Again, it is not for everyone, but it does offer a group to talk to during this pandemic lol. | seeker: I guess I can at least try it. | seeker: Thanks for all the great advice"

By exploring how the client is taking care of themselves, I can help them identify any positive coping mechanisms they may be using and potentially build on those strengths.

    "original_question": "Questions: How do you think your close co-worker's similar feelings towards the principal might be a source of support or comfort for you, and have you considered talking to them about ways to cope with the situation together?\nExplanation: I ask this question because the seeker has mentioned having a close co-worker who shares similar feelings towards the principal. This could be a potential source of emotional support and validation for the seeker. By exploring this relationship, we can identify potential coping strategies and ways to manage the stress and negativity caused by the principal's behavior. Additionally, talking to someone who understands the situation can help the seeker feel less isolated and more empowered to deal with the challenges they are facing.",
