You may need to talk to them and let them know how you feel about that. | supporter: How long has this been going on? | seeker: I'm nervous about asking them why | seeker: and it happens on and off like when they feel lie it i guess i will say maybe 4 months | supporter: I understand that, but if you want to get to a point that you feel better about it then you will have to speak to them. | seeker: yes i know i hope everything be immediately resolved and not lead into other problems and end of friendshps | supporter: Do you see them everyday? | supporter: I understand that, are you able to go over there. | seeker: no i dont live in the same city anymore | seeker: when i go out of town i can visit but with covid19 rules | supporter: Well I can see that you have put the effort in to try and keep the relationship so it sounds like the ball is in their court if they want to do the same. | seeker: yes | supporter: Well that is about all that can be done and wait for them to come around...Do you have any hobbies? | seeker: yes i like to read and play music | supporter: I like to go on runs every morning. It helps to clear my mind and makes it easier to brush things off when they bother me. | supporter: What instrument do you play? | seeker: my sister goes on runs in the morning time and says it relax her for the day i think i migh | seeker: i played the piano when i was in highschool | supporter: It is a really good stress reliever. I played when I was younger, didn't ever get very good. Did you? | seeker: no i didn't i had to stop because i have what the doctors call a trigger finger it caused great pain when i would practice | supporter: Hmm, well maybe take some more lessons, We can always strive to be better at everything we do. | seeker: yes that is true | supporter: Maybe take a run in order to clear your mind. | supporter: I'm sure they will come around. | seeker: i think i would start off walking i am not in shape to run | seeker: yes i will give them time maybe stop reaching out so much | supporter: That may be a good idea. Good talk | seeker: yes thank you for talking with me and giving great advice"

      "context": "supporter: Hi there, how are you feeling today? | seeker: Hello | supporter: Hi :) Is there anything you'd like to talk about? Something on your mind? | seeker: I'm concerned about my job. I have been out of work for the past 5 weeks because I tested positive for COVID-19. | supporter: Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? | supporter: Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? | supporter: (sorry for duplication, not sure what happened there!) | seeker: It just keeps getting better... I applied for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and was approved. The next day, I got an email asking me to verify my identity (I am fine with that. It actually makes good sense.)... | supporter: So you have been getting some assistance? | seeker: So I did as instructed and got the message on the website thanking me for verification. The following week I got a physical letter saying I was approved and the award amount per week. | seeker: I have gone online once a week and qualified, as one is supposed to do, and still I have not received a cent. | supporter: I see, so you are really financially struggling at the moment? Is there anywhere else you could apply for assistance? What about a foodbank? | seeker: Calling the customer service line is futile. The computer just plays a recording that the agents are on other calls and then it disconnects the call. | supporter: I hear you there - I spent a long time on hold for an official matter the other day. I guess that everyone is really desperate for help and advice right now. | seeker: I have been very fortunate. People in my church have been bringing me food. I plan on trying to go to the food bank Monday, if they are open. | supporter: I hope that they can help you. My partner and I have used one before and they were very helpful. I felt a bit ashamed but there was no judgement at all. | seeker: I actually got so tired of redialing the Department of Labor and Training that I sent an email to the Lieutenant Governor of the state asking for his assistance in getting the matter resolved. | supporter: That sounds like a very positive thing to have done. I really hope that they pay some attention to you. This situation is not your fault! | seeker: I have been to this food bank once before, and they actually made me feel very comfortable and welcomed and gave me an information package on other ways the parent organization may be able to assist me. | supporter: Yes they are run by lovely people. Ours gave us a pamphlet for cheap and easy to make recipes too. | seeker: I am very lucky in that the organization is only 3 miles from me. I will be looking into their rent assistance and employment assistance programs as well. | supporter: So, at least it sounds like you have a good handle on this and are doing everything you can to help yourself, am I right? | seeker: I have an advantage because I have a professional background in cooking, so I can take random ingredients and turn them into wonderful and nutritious meals. I just need to have the ingredients. | supporter: That sounds very encouraging! It's amazing what you can make even with cheap food. Noodles , for instance, are very versatile :) | seeker: You are right. I am definitely not going to sit and pout. I am just a bit frustrated with the system. | supporter: It's a very strange situation and I suspect that some of the authorities just feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to cope. | seeker: I am concerned that my boss may try to not take me back at my job. Because this is an \"at will\" state, he can terminate me without cause. Although he can not legally fire me for being ill with COVID, he can take me back and simply release me the same day saying that I have become redundant."

No, it's happened before, being along for the holidays; but you've helped to cheer me up, so thanks! | supporter: No problem, I hope I have made your day a little better! | seeker: You have, thanks! Did you do anything special? | supporter: Have a good rest of this year and don't forget to make your New Year's resolution! | seeker: I will do that - you too. Thanks, again... | supporter: Not really, stayed home lol... Have a good one! | seeker: You too... bye now... | supporter: Good day!"

The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, I had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, I asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and I realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter. Would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions? | seeker: I have encouraged my friends to block them as well, but a new account always pops up. My ex really will not give up."

I will find it difficult to sustain if this continues like this for other 3 months. | supporter: So it sounds like you've been struggling with finding a new job. It's never easy looking for a new job during these times. Why do you think you're having trouble? | seeker: Getting a job is not that difficult. But I try to find a job in my locality to avoid distant from family and having food issues. | supporter: It sounds like you're motivated and dealing with a lot. Is there a specific job that you had in mind or are you applying to different kinds of jobs? | seeker: Any kind of job, probably managerial. But to be in my locality since to look after my aged mom also. | supporter: It sounds like you really care to want to be close to home. Have you talked with someone locally about jobs that would allow you to stay close to home? | seeker: I have been talking to some people who my friends knows also. They show interest but cannot help me on the issue. | seeker: Surely they will refer to some people. But it will take some time. | supporter: Stay motivated. If one opportunity doesn't get your desired response you may be even closer to finding the right job for you. Keep pushing on and know that if one opportunity doesn't work out a positive attitude will make all the difference. Just because you haven't found one yet doesn't mean you won't. | seeker: Thanks for making confidence. I feel relaxed. I believe this will surely be a chance to find myself and get a better opportunity to be relieved from my previous difficulties. Only GOD should have forced me this way, I believe. | supporter: Your faith is healthy and gives you purpose. Similarly you have to believe that the dots will connect in your favor. Maybe you can't connect them looking forward, but looking backwards you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. | seeker: I felt anger over my previous employer since he was not giving any time for me to switch over, at least 2 months. | seeker: Even then he was satisfied till then. | supporter: It can be frustrating to focus on your last job, especially if you haven't found a new one yet. Perhaps once you find a new job your disappointment with the last one won't be so disappointing anymore. If the new job is better you wouldn't have found it working the last job. | seeker: Anyhow my loyalty was not encouraged to perform more. I have to move from some back again. | seeker: Any I am preparing myself better, using the break time to gain my knowledge further and sharpen my skills, reading and viewing many articles in the net and youtube. I helps me a lot. | supporter: It's great that you're staying productive and improving yourself. If your desire to improve yourself is as strong as your desire to find a new job I'm confident you will. | seeker: It helps me to forget the past and concentrate on the future. | supporter: Don't let your past define you, let your present choices pave a new path into the future. | seeker: I am going forward only. I think I am very close to the treasure, not knowing how many hits to dig. | seeker: I require your greetings for a better prospectus. . | supporter: I'm confident you will."

We have hurt each other many times and he is a daily drug user and is very much a fair weather friend. | supporter: Ouch! That is a sad thing. As I was sitting here thinking about friends I have moved on from, sadly, most of the time it was for the best, even though it hurt at the time. | seeker: My friend stopped showing up when he said he would and I slowly stopped answering his calls and texts. | supporter: Life is a journey, and as we walk toward goals in our life, people either join us or bring us down. Sometimes they only walk on the path we are on for a short time, sometimes longer. I have very few friends from High School, 2 to be exact. And only on FB, that was back in 1979 too. lol I'm old, but I have had to move on from destructive relationships, as you are doing now. It can be hard. | seeker: This is so strange and wonderful connecting with a stranger about this! Wow. That's true. I kept trying to get my friends clean and to work on a hobby with me but drugs destroyed my two best friends and killed one of them. | supporter: Ouch! That sounds hard. I had friends like that too. I had to walk away. Has your friend asked you why you are ignoring him? The reason I ask this is because it's good to get some closure and let them know their behavior is destructive and you need space from that. | seeker: No, he seemed to respond with pride. He deleted his facebook and never talked to me again after that. | supporter: I have learned in life that unhealthy people run from problems, healthy people stick in the mud with you and try to work out issues."

The job was second shift.

I understand medical issues can cause all kinds of problems in our lives. | seeker: I have been using a CPAP for 6 years and have dramatically reduced my drinking. It is amazing how refreshed I am all day now compared with any day during that time even the days I didn't drink because there were overall health effects that stayed with me. | supporter: I understand.. | supporter: has the quality of your life improved? | seeker: Yes I'm more enthusiastic about my life and family relations are better and I have built trust back up. | supporter: It's the small things that add up to a big picture.. | supporter: How is your Christmas going? | seeker: Fairly well; we talked to my brother who lives 1200 miles away and didn't come up due to COVID-19. I am making plans with a few friends to se an award-winning light display.

Exams? Relationships? | seeker: Yes! Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well. | seeker: Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough. | supporter: I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now? | seeker: I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot | supporter: Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that. | supporter: For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. | supporter: I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much. | seeker: Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? | seeker: I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating. | supporter: Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule. | seeker: Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school. | supporter: Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. | supporter: Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments. | seeker: Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break | seeker: I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe. | supporter: Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books. | supporter: Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing."

Have you had any contact with her since? | seeker: Only once and she was just telling me that I was a horrible person. | seeker: This all started over her stopping her meds and then I asked her to clean her room. | supporter: That sounds very toxic. Is it possible to persuade her to seek medical help? I realise she might be reluctant to | seeker: We have tried to get her into therapy again. But, COVID put a block on that. | seeker: I suggested that she go back to the ward and maybe be placed into a group home. | supporter: Ah yes, it is a terrible time at the moment isn't it? I think a lot of people are not getting the medical help that they need because of the virus | supporter: Please do not beat yourself up over this - it does sound as though you have done absolutely everything you could to help. | seeker: I would hate to see that happen, but Im at my wits end. | supporter: I can tell that you feel really bad about this just from your tone of voice. Please remember that you can't fix everything in the world. | seeker: Now my dads side of the family hates me because they say Im \"mean to her\". All I asked her to do was to clean her room and maybe socialize every once in a while. | seeker: Im more mad than sad. | supporter: Socialising can be hard for people with mental health problems. It might have been best if you did not press her too hard to do that though I know you did not realise. | seeker: I understand, but I think it would have better than sitting in a dark room all day."

I think most of us do but just don't speak up about it. Also being away from your friends and family can cause feelings of doubt because you may not feel like you have trusted ones to lean on. However | supporter: You should try to take some time out of each day to instead of question yourself to congratulate yourself, because you are doing tough things on your own but hey youre DOING IT! | seeker: Do you have any tips on how to deal with headaches or being overly stressed or anxious? | supporter: For anxiety and stress i would sugesst taking time out away from all your chores and tasks and just be to yourself. What is something you enjoy? May a cup of tea or an episode of the office. You always have to take a moment for yourself | seeker: So something like going for a run, or watching a funny movie? | supporter: Meditation, yoga, a warm bath these things can also be soothing as well. SOmetimes using kinectic energy up can help as well like going for a brisk walk to burn off the adrenaline that causes anxiety | seeker: Thank you for the ideas | seeker: But what if you get so stressed you can't really think of anything else? | supporter: Yes! Heck go all out and do both is you have a treadmill ha ha ! do what makes YOU happy even if just for a moment | supporter: IF your stress has become that high, then you go ahead and aknowledge the anxiety that is flowing through you. Give it you attention and close your eyes and start to ask yourself what is the root of what is scaring me. What is the official thoing i am afrad of or worried about. When our thoughts begin to race its hard to focus and we make mistakes and that adds to the stress. | seeker: Thank you so much, your advice will be really helpful!"

Now I don't know what to do with myself without her. | supporter: I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. | supporter: That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year | seeker: Not only that, but with Covid going on I have noone i can see to talk about it. | supporter: Do you have any family? | seeker: Yes, i do, but they are far away. | supporter: Friends closeby? | supporter: Hobbies? | supporter: What kind of work do you do? | seeker: I do have friends, who are also friends with her. However they have families and do not visit prople because of covid. | seeker: I don't have any true hobbies. I don't think they will fill the void anyways. | supporter: Well you know, I have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow. | seeker: I do software development, but its a work at home situation. So i have been just by myself for the last week, and its driving me crazy. All i do is think about why she would do that. | seeker: I've had time to myself but its not getting any better. | supporter: I have always tried to think of things in a positive way. This way even when something really bad happens, it doesn't seem so bad as to overwhelm us from recovering. | seeker: What positive are there here?"

Same as always, on and off work, having a meal with the girlfriend, that sort. (It would help if this system shows us if one of us is typing..) | supporter: I understand that times are rough lately. Sounds like there is some time to figure it out, take full advantage of all the time you can. I hope it works out and a new position becomes available, I know your story is shared by many right now. What a crazy time we are in | supporter: yes it does, on top it says inputing | seeker: Ah fair, that's good to know | seeker: Yes, still it doesn't quite help that no matter how many CVs you submit, hit rates for jobs just don't go up. | supporter: what are cv's?

Have you been in a scary car accident before or know anyone? Have you offered them kindness or you just dismissed them and thought it was their own problem? | seeker: That sounds scary. And is extremely unfortunate. | supporter: I'm sorry that you didn't get the support you needed after your accidents because it's hard enough to go through the pain and trauma (mental and physical) to begin with and the support is much needed. | seeker: Absolutely! But I'm doing better now. You find out who your real friends and family are and you move on.

If she has such bad manners then I think that you cn do better. | seeker: That is a great point. A rather gauche move on her part, dontcha think? | seeker: Have you ever had someone dump you?? | supporter: Yes I do. I would not personally do that to someone even if I was unhappy in relationship. | seeker: Yeah, I hear you. | supporter: Yes I have been dumped. We had been together for eight years and he left me for another woman. | seeker: I feel disgusted so much that I got played \"like an old fiddle.\" It sucks..... | supporter: I know how you are feeling but I think that you need to get professional help to move on. Are you able to go to therapy? | seeker: I haven't thought about getting therapy. What would help? | supporter: Well, I think it could be really beneficial to let your anger out | seeker: I am glad to be able to vent to you about my girl's actions. I hope she is not going to hook up with my \"wing man,' Rick. I would be filled with even more disgust."

I need some financial planners to help as well. Many Americans are hurting. | supporter: If you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative. Just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic. | seeker: Any other advices? | seeker: What else can you advise me on? | seeker: Should I look elsewhere for jobs? | seeker: I will have to try that. Maybe it can help me ease my mind. | supporter: Since a lot of this stress is being caused by your childhood trauma, it seems like there is something that connects that job to your trauma and if it cant be disconnected, it seems like you should find another job. | supporter: And I understand that is not the easiest in these times but I believe you can do it! | seeker: It is not easy right now.

I am sorry to hear that though - I know how much it hurts when you split with someone, especially if it was not consensual. | supporter: It's a lousy time of year for it too, isn't it? | seeker: I feel like a piece of crap, and childish at that. I can't maintain any of my relationships. I think I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life. | supporter: That is a defeatist way to talk!

I hate it when I realise that I am not being rational but I can't seem to stop myself sometimes and this has sometimes let to problems with my inter personal relationships | seeker: Yea, that definitely seems to be part of my problem. I really thought he was different, too.

It's horrible to feel that you are losing your self respect but I suspect that we've all done it at some point. Have you considered getting some counselling? | seeker: Sigh.. yes. I have seen several. I also take meds from a psychiatrist. | supporter: I hear you saying that they are not really effective, is that true? | seeker: Well... one told me that I should be put down like a dog to my face. | seeker: so, yea | supporter: Okay .. I hope you reported him!! | seeker: I didn't. I was younger then. who knows. not gonna lie. maybe they're right. Sometimes I think I'm a psycho.

It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. | supporter: You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. | supporter: How old are the both of you? | seeker: Okay. I will keep that in mind. | seeker: We are 22. | supporter: Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? | seeker: Yes but less over the past few months. | supporter: Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. | supporter: I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related....for him. | supporter: Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. | supporter: You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. | seeker: That's understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. | supporter: How do you all generally communicate? Through text? | seeker: He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends. | supporter: Which do you and your man like to communicate? | seeker: No live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person. | seeker: I communicate much more than he does. Thats why I think he is hiding something. | supporter: Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot. | seeker: You are right. I will try to be more sensitive about that. Thank you for your help. | supporter: I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you. | seeker: Do you think getting other people involved is a good idea? | supporter: I would be subtle about that tactic. | supporter: If you haven't met any of his school mates. I wouldn't pursue that option. Have you met any of his class mates? | seeker: Yeah he has a few close friends but he is pretty to himself.

My partner is cheating on me. | supporter: Cheating on you? | seeker: Yes. | seeker: With another woman. | supporter: How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? | supporter: Did he tell you that he is? | seeker: I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. | seeker: He will not admit it himself. | supporter: I am sorry if your partner is cheating. | supporter: So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? | supporter: Are you and your partner married? | seeker: Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. | seeker: We are not married but we live together. | supporter: How long have you been in a relationship with your man? | seeker: 2 years | supporter: So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. | seeker: What do you mean exactly? | supporter: Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. | seeker: I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. | supporter: Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. | seeker: That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. | supporter: I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. | seeker: Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous? | supporter: Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. | seeker: That is a good point. | supporter: Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. | supporter: Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. | seeker: I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. | seeker: But I appreciate your suggestions | seeker: and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile | supporter: Sure, I understand. | seeker: I should trust my partner more than any random person. | supporter: Yes, the workplace is not like home life. | supporter: Yes, trust matters. | seeker: But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? | supporter: I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work.

It's a gig job, much like mturk, but the company is dropping people from my state on that date. | supporter: I know its tough especially with the holidays and all. You have so many great skills and are such a hard worker I dont think you will have a problem at all finding something different. | seeker: I've been looking at other companies, but learning a new system after all these years is difficult. | supporter: I remember a time I lost my job and felt my whole world crumbling but then I realized when one door closes another door opens. when those doors close it seems that its usually for the best because it opens the path for something bigger and greater for you. | seeker: That's true. I've thought about looking into new fields. | supporter: Have you looked into some evening classes or maybe online schooling? I hear there are so many different options when it comes to online learning. | seeker: I was looking into that last night, but with covid, classes have had to cut enrollment and are already full for next semester. | supporter: They are full? well what about surrounding towns? Have you sat down and really thought about your passions and what you enjoy doing?

All I care about is helping others so as long as the choice i make supports that then it will be fine. | seeker: thank you for your help | supporter: No problem, and it's great that you like helping others. | supporter: I am a firm believer that ultimately making others happy is what makes us happy. | seeker: yes, it is very rewarding to do so, it should be a part of everyone's life choices | seeker: i agree with you on that | supporter: Remember to always keep a positive mindset.

The more prepared you are for that test, the more manageable you will find it and the less stressed you will feel. | seeker: Yes I am pretty good about that but it just kills my free time because I am working full time. | supporter: I understand.

You will be doing what you like for a good living. Think about the future. | seeker: That is certainly the plan | supporter: Just remember not to stress too much about it. It's just one test at the end of the day, you can do this! | seeker: Yes I am not super worried about it it is more the stress from not having free time, also insurance textbooks are not extremely exciting. | supporter: I know that I told you to try to fit school time into your schedule, but the same goes with leisure time for yourself. Find an activity that you enjoy and try to dedicate at least an hour a day to it, be it exercising, playing videogames, reading a book. | seeker: Yes that is good advice, I try to find time for myself but time seems to disappear sometimes | supporter: Happens to all of us. I myself sometimes get too invested in work and the days go by without me realizing it, but it should definetely be a priority.

Sometimes that can happen when you look back on yourself. | supporter: What is making you angry about the past? | seeker: I am angry I trusted my ex partner. They cheated on me and tried to hide it for months. | supporter: I can personally relate to that myself. I have went through something similar like that 4 years ago. It can be very frustrating when it happens. | seeker: What do you do when you are reminded of that situation or think about the person? | supporter: The easiest thing that I did in my situation was obtained a new hobby. I took my anger out on my ex by joining Crossfit and interacted with that community. It helped me take my mind of from my ex. | seeker: I've seen that Crossfit helps a lot of people. That is a good idea but it is kind of intimidating | supporter: Crossfit may not be for everyone, but do you think a new hobby may help you? Have you taken one in recently? | seeker: I have recently started painting and it is very relaxing | supporter: Painting is an excellent hobby. I can see that it's relaxing as well as help put your emotions into something physical. | seeker: Yes. I usually do it while listening to podcasts. It is a great distraction | supporter: It sounds like that you are doing great with your hobby. Have you try to interact with anyone else, such as an art community or your friends on your feedback? | seeker: I have but not many of my friends have been in the position I was or understand how I feel | supporter: Yea, I can see why that may make you feel alone in that aspect. I thought about that myself, but there are groups that can help you out. Strangers in fact. I went on Reddit to express my frustrations and it can help to just let out your anger. | seeker: Personally I've heard that Reddit can be really toxic | supporter: It can be, but seeing several posts in their groups, most offer advice or at least sympathy. It is kind of like what we are doing right now to be honest. Again, it is not for everyone, but it does offer a group to talk to during this pandemic lol. | seeker: I guess I can at least try it. | seeker: Thanks for all the great advice"

I have to attend zoom meetings with her several times per week and she can pop into any of my classes randomly | seeker: She does know that but we had a negative interaction once and she's been horrible ever since | supporter: Seems like she is domineering . Tries to disrupt the class environment | seeker: Yes! She is quick to divert blame away from herself and is not a good supporter of most teachers, except the ones she favors | supporter: So there a personality issue between her and you. She won't let the issue go | supporter: And you r not one of her favorites i guess | supporter: How long have you been there | seeker: No, she is pretty petty about it. It was actually easier to deal with when we were in school because I could avoid her. But now we have mandatory meetings... I am definitely not one of her favorites | seeker: 1 1/2 years and normally I would change schools but the pandemic has made that harder | supporter: Is there anyone above her you could talk with | seeker: There's no way I would do that... it would make things even worse for me | supporter: Have you checked with other schools and maybe submitted your resume online to ones that are far away as well | supporter: I know with the virus it is hard | supporter: Who do u know that u can talk with | seeker: I have looked at other schools but it's hard to try and get a new position in my area. | seeker: I have a close co-worker who feels the same way I do about her. | supporter: How many teachers are at your school | seeker: We text one another during our zoom meetings which does take some anxiety off of me | seeker: there are 60 | supporter: So is there a circle of teachers that you can chat with besides your co-worker | supporter: Or is there a group who would snitch on you | seeker: On some levels, but she is really the only one I trust | supporter: What would it take for you to talk with the principal to work things out | seeker: Being a different person. I'm hoping the vaccine will bring the pandemic to an end and I can move on to another school"
