It encourages the client to consider taking active steps to address the situation\n2. It focuses on emotional expression rather than financial matters, which seems to be a sensitive topic\n3. It suggests addressing the issue with one friend first (making it less overwhelming than confronting the whole group)\n4. It helps explore whether communication channels can be reopened by focusing on the friendship itself\n5.

Something on your mind? | seeker: I'm concerned about my job. I have been out of work for the past 5 weeks because I tested positive for COVID-19. | supporter: Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? | supporter: Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? | supporter: (sorry for duplication, not sure what happened there!) | seeker: It just keeps getting better... I applied for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and was approved. The next day, I got an email asking me to verify my identity (I am fine with that. It actually makes good sense.)... | supporter: So you have been getting some assistance? | seeker: So I did as instructed and got the message on the website thanking me for verification. The following week I got a physical letter saying I was approved and the award amount per week. | seeker: I have gone online once a week and qualified, as one is supposed to do, and still I have not received a cent. | supporter: I see, so you are really financially struggling at the moment? Is there anywhere else you could apply for assistance? What about a foodbank? | seeker: Calling the customer service line is futile. The computer just plays a recording that the agents are on other calls and then it disconnects the call. | supporter: I hear you there - I spent a long time on hold for an official matter the other day. I guess that everyone is really desperate for help and advice right now. | seeker: I have been very fortunate. People in my church have been bringing me food. I plan on trying to go to the food bank Monday, if they are open. | supporter: I hope that they can help you. My partner and I have used one before and they were very helpful. I felt a bit ashamed but there was no judgement at all. | seeker: I actually got so tired of redialing the Department of Labor and Training that I sent an email to the Lieutenant Governor of the state asking for his assistance in getting the matter resolved. | supporter: That sounds like a very positive thing to have done. I really hope that they pay some attention to you. This situation is not your fault! | seeker: I have been to this food bank once before, and they actually made me feel very comfortable and welcomed and gave me an information package on other ways the parent organization may be able to assist me. | supporter: Yes they are run by lovely people. Ours gave us a pamphlet for cheap and easy to make recipes too. | seeker: I am very lucky in that the organization is only 3 miles from me. I will be looking into their rent assistance and employment assistance programs as well. | supporter: So, at least it sounds like you have a good handle on this and are doing everything you can to help yourself, am I right? | seeker: I have an advantage because I have a professional background in cooking, so I can take random ingredients and turn them into wonderful and nutritious meals. I just need to have the ingredients. | supporter: That sounds very encouraging! It's amazing what you can make even with cheap food. Noodles , for instance, are very versatile :) | seeker: You are right. I am definitely not going to sit and pout. I am just a bit frustrated with the system. | supporter: It's a very strange situation and I suspect that some of the authorities just feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to cope. | seeker: I am concerned that my boss may try to not take me back at my job. Because this is an \"at will\" state, he can terminate me without cause. Although he can not legally fire me for being ill with COVID, he can take me back and simply release me the same day saying that I have become redundant."

Can you tell me if you’ve tried other things to get them to stop? | seeker: I have confronted them in person but it was dramatic to say the least. They basically had a meltdown that they don't want to lose me | supporter: You tried to do the right thing and they are having a difficult time letting go. The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, I had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, I asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and I realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter. Would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions? | seeker: I have encouraged my friends to block them as well, but a new account always pops up. My ex really will not give up."

    "original_question": "Question: Have you considered seeking legal advice or speaking with a professional about getting a restraining order, given that your ex continues to create new accounts and won't stop the harassment?\n\nExplanation: This question is appropriate because:\n1. The situation has escalated beyond simple social media blocking, with the ex creating multiple accounts and showing persistent harassing behavior\n2. The client has already tried multiple approaches (documenting, confronting, blocking, having friends block) with no success\n3. While authorities previously said it wasn't \"dangerous or criminal,\" the persistent nature of the harassment might now qualify for legal intervention\n4. It helps move the conversation toward practical solutions while validating that the situation is serious enough to warrant legal protection",

It allows the seeker to process their emotions by articulating their feelings about the relationship\n3. It helps validate their grief by giving them space to express what they've lost\n4. It moves away from problem-solving (meditation, websites, etc.) which the seeker seems resistant to, and instead focuses on emotional processing\n5.

How can I encourage you today? | supporter: Sorry that posted twice! :o | seeker: Hey so my best friend finally stopped showing up. We're growing apart... | supporter: You are growing apart from your best friend? Is this a good thing or not a good thing? Or you aren't sure? | seeker: It's an expected thing but it's sad. We have hurt each other many times and he is a daily drug user and is very much a fair weather friend. | supporter: Ouch! That is a sad thing. As I was sitting here thinking about friends I have moved on from, sadly, most of the time it was for the best, even though it hurt at the time. | seeker: My friend stopped showing up when he said he would and I slowly stopped answering his calls and texts. | supporter: Life is a journey, and as we walk toward goals in our life, people either join us or bring us down. Sometimes they only walk on the path we are on for a short time, sometimes longer. I have very few friends from High School, 2 to be exact. And only on FB, that was back in 1979 too. lol I'm old, but I have had to move on from destructive relationships, as you are doing now. It can be hard. | seeker: This is so strange and wonderful connecting with a stranger about this! Wow. That's true. I kept trying to get my friends clean and to work on a hobby with me but drugs destroyed my two best friends and killed one of them. | supporter: Ouch! That sounds hard. I had friends like that too. I had to walk away. Has your friend asked you why you are ignoring him? The reason I ask this is because it's good to get some closure and let them know their behavior is destructive and you need space from that. | seeker: No, he seemed to respond with pride. He deleted his facebook and never talked to me again after that. | supporter: I have learned in life that unhealthy people run from problems, healthy people stick in the mud with you and try to work out issues."

It gently guides them to explore alternative coping strategies they might already have but haven't recognized\n3. It focuses on practical solutions while validating their feelings\n4. It keeps the conversation solution-focused without dismissing their pain\n5.

Please know that I am happy to listen and to help you if I can! | seeker: Thank you for that. I really miss my girlfriend. | supporter: I am sorry to hear that. Have you separated or can you just not be together at Christmas? | seeker: We are separated. She said I was watching too much Buzzr and didn't pay enough attention to her, so she dumped me. | supporter: That is not good. But relationships can be reestablished if you talk. Have you considered seeing a third party to help you both talk this out? | seeker: We tried to see a counselor. It did go too well, the counselor took her side on everything, it was very unprofessional. | supporter: I seem, so do I hear you saying that you feel that everyone is against you on this and that you feel powerless? | seeker: It feels like that way. Even my parents seem to support her more than me. I am all alone now watching a Buzzr marathon with no one to truly support me. | supporter: I am sorry that your parents are not being more supportive. I understand how hard it is when you have a break up and loved ones seem to support your ex! | seeker: Has this happened to you before? | supporter: Please know that you are not alone in this situation and that there will be light at the end of the tunnel. | supporter: Yes it has .. my boyfriend left me for someone else and most of our mutual friends took his side! | seeker: I am sorry to hear that, I think your boyfriend made a big mistake leaving you, you seem like a very nice and sweet person. | supporter: Thank you :) I am sure that there is someone else out there for you too if you cannot reconcile with your ex. The question is, how much do you really want to? You might be better off without her | seeker: That might be true, she really blew it with me, I am a good catch. | supporter: That is a good way to think! Never let something like this destroy your self esteem. | seeker: I agree. You know, you are very good at this. Did you end up finding a new boyfriend or husband? | supporter: Yes, I am engaged now. I realise that my ex did me the biggest favour anyone ever could! | seeker: Well that is a good success story! Thank you for the motivation. | supporter: Maybe you should think about talking to a counsellor or something about this, just to work through your feelings? | seeker: Yes I will do that. Thank you for your support. | supporter: You are most welcome. I have a few minutes left to talk if there's anything else on your mind?"

How can I encourage you today? | seeker: Hi, I have been going through a lot of stress with school and am also sad and lonely as of late and not sure how to make myself feel better | supporter: So you have had a lot of stress with school lately and are struggling to keep yourself cheerful? | supporter: Is there something in particular at school that is stressing you out? Exams? Relationships? | seeker: Yes! Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well. | seeker: Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough. | supporter: I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now? | seeker: I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot | supporter: Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that. | supporter: For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. | supporter: I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much. | seeker: Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? | seeker: I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating. | supporter: Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule. | seeker: Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school. | supporter: Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. | supporter: Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments. | seeker: Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break | seeker: I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe. | supporter: Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books. | supporter: Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing."

It may reveal potential issues in the current relationship that could be addressed more constructively\n4. The client has shown some self-awareness in their last response (\"wanting my cake and eat it too\"), so this question builds on that moment of insight to dig deeper into their motivations\n\nThe question avoids criticism",

You always have to take a moment for yourself | seeker: So something like going for a run, or watching a funny movie? | supporter: Meditation, yoga, a warm bath these things can also be soothing as well. SOmetimes using kinectic energy up can help as well like going for a brisk walk to burn off the adrenaline that causes anxiety | seeker: Thank you for the ideas | seeker: But what if you get so stressed you can't really think of anything else? | supporter: Yes! Heck go all out and do both is you have a treadmill ha ha ! do what makes YOU happy even if just for a moment | supporter: IF your stress has become that high, then you go ahead and aknowledge the anxiety that is flowing through you. Give it you attention and close your eyes and start to ask yourself what is the root of what is scaring me. What is the official thoing i am afrad of or worried about.

The question shows empathy and helps establish emotional rapport while gathering important information about their current emotional state, which will help guide the subsequent support and discussion.

Same as always, on and off work, having a meal with the girlfriend, that sort. (It would help if this system shows us if one of us is typing..) | supporter: I understand that times are rough lately. Sounds like there is some time to figure it out, take full advantage of all the time you can. I hope it works out and a new position becomes available, I know your story is shared by many right now. What a crazy time we are in | supporter: yes it does, on top it says inputing | seeker: Ah fair, that's good to know | seeker: Yes, still it doesn't quite help that no matter how many CVs you submit, hit rates for jobs just don't go up. | supporter: what are cv's?

How do you feel about retaking it? | seeker: I don't mind retaking it, really | supporter: Ah so you feel that this is going to be severely disruptive to your plans for this winter break? | seeker: yha. also, im worried i might fail again if i get too distracted by my family | supporter: Is it possible for you to get any sort of private tutoring which might help you? | seeker: i mean, tutoring is just another added time commitment. I really failed the first time because i was depressed and unmotivated. which is why I'm excited to be with my family finally | supporter: Ah .. in that case is it possible to talk to your doctor? They might be able to get a special allowance for you given your personal circumstances | seeker: yeah. that's another thing. I havent told my therapist or even my parents yet | seeker: that i failed | supporter: I think that it would be a really good idea if you talked to them about it.

It explores a recent experience of disclosure that could provide insights into how other family members might react\n2. Since the client is anxious about telling their parents, understanding their sister's supportive response (if it was positive) could help build confidence for future difficult conversations\n3. It allows the client to reflect on a presumably safer disclosure experience before taking the bigger step of telling their parents\n4. If the sister's reaction was understanding, it could help reinforce the previous point about family being more understanding than expected\n5.

I have experienced that myself. | seeker: Yeah, I bet many have. It is not a very Civil society. | seeker: Very uncivil method of breaking up.... | supporter: It really is not is it! I can tell how upset you feel just from talking to you, and also that the method of the break up is really sore point. | seeker: It just disgusts me how gauche my girl's method was. Maybe people should be more polite about how they communicate about something like breaking up. | supporter: It could be that you are better off without her?

I need some financial planners to help as well. Many Americans are hurting. | supporter: If you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative.

Is there anything you'd like to talk about today? | seeker: Going through a break-up. My 3rd one this year.... | seeker: Nice to meet you too | seeker: It suckssssss | supporter: Gosh you've been busy :). I am sorry to hear that though - I know how much it hurts when you split with someone, especially if it was not consensual. | supporter: It's a lousy time of year for it too, isn't it? | seeker: I feel like a piece of crap, and childish at that. I can't maintain any of my relationships. I think I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life. | supporter: That is a defeatist way to talk! Just because a couple of relationships fail does not mean that you will never be able to find happiness. | seeker: Well, if past experience has any powers of prediction. I get super clingy, and do this push and pull thingy, where I break up and call them names, and then become so embarrassed it's hard to even bring it up. my last boyfriend said he thought i had borderline disorder | supporter: I have been in that position too. I hate it when I realise that I am not being rational but I can't seem to stop myself sometimes and this has sometimes let to problems with my inter personal relationships | seeker: Yea, that definitely seems to be part of my problem. I really thought he was different, too. And when he broke up with me, I tried to get him to spend the night with me in a hotel, and I felt so pathetic because I was practically begging for sex | seeker: I think I am an addict. | supporter: I hear you on that one too! It's horrible to feel that you are losing your self respect but I suspect that we've all done it at some point. Have you considered getting some counselling? | seeker: Sigh.. yes. I have seen several. I also take meds from a psychiatrist. | supporter: I hear you saying that they are not really effective, is that true? | seeker: Well... one told me that I should be put down like a dog to my face. | seeker: so, yea | supporter: Okay .. I hope you reported him!! | seeker: I didn't. I was younger then. who knows. not gonna lie. maybe they're right. Sometimes I think I'm a psycho. My last therapist was always doing deep breathing exercises. It didn't help. | seeker: I also have a lot of anxiety. A LOT! | seeker: I even got an emotiona support dog"

How should I approach him to communicate better? | supporter: I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you....even after work. | seeker: okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. | supporter: Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. | supporter: Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. | seeker: That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. | supporter: You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. | supporter: How old are the both of you? | seeker: Okay. I will keep that in mind. | seeker: We are 22. | supporter: Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? | seeker: Yes but less over the past few months. | supporter: Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. | supporter: I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related....for him. | supporter: Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. | supporter: You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. | seeker: That's understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. | supporter: How do you all generally communicate? Through text? | seeker: He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends. | supporter: Which do you and your man like to communicate? | seeker: No live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person. | seeker: I communicate much more than he does. Thats why I think he is hiding something. | supporter: Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot. | seeker: You are right. I will try to be more sensitive about that. Thank you for your help. | supporter: I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you. | seeker: Do you think getting other people involved is a good idea? | supporter: I would be subtle about that tactic. | supporter: If you haven't met any of his school mates. I wouldn't pursue that option. Have you met any of his class mates? | seeker: Yeah he has a few close friends but he is pretty to himself. We both live far away from home. | supporter: Are you and him directly off campuses in housing? You both attend the same college, correct? | seeker: Yes off campus. Same college."
