## Evaluation 16 (ID: 17)

### Context
**Situation:** I have been out of work for five weeks in quarantine due to testing positive for COVID-19.  I fear that my employer will not take me back to work even once I test negative.

**Conversation:** supporter: Hi there, how are you feeling today? | seeker: Hello | supporter: Hi :) Is there anything you'd like to talk about? Something on your mind? | seeker: I'm concerned about my job. I have been out of work for the past 5 weeks because I tested positive for COVID-19. | supporter: Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? | supporter: Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? | supporter: (sorry for duplication, not sure what happened there!) | seeker: It just keeps getting better... I applied for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and was approved. The next day, I got an email asking me to verify my identity (I am fine with that. It actually makes good sense.)... | supporter: So you have been getting some assistance? | seeker: So I did as instructed and got the message on the website thanking me for verification. The following week I got a physical letter saying I was approved and the award amount per week. | seeker: I have gone online once a week and qualified, as one is supposed to do, and still I have not received a cent. | supporter: I see, so you are really financially struggling at the moment? Is there anywhere else you could apply for assistance? What about a foodbank? | seeker: Calling the customer service line is futile. The computer just plays a recording that the agents are on other calls and then it disconnects the call. | supporter: I hear you there - I spent a long time on hold for an official matter the other day. I guess that everyone is really desperate for help and advice right now. | seeker: I have been very fortunate. People in my church have been bringing me food. I plan on trying to go to the food bank Monday, if they are open. | supporter: I hope that they can help you. My partner and I have used one before and they were very helpful. I felt a bit ashamed but there was no judgement at all. | seeker: I actually got so tired of redialing the Department of Labor and Training that I sent an email to the Lieutenant Governor of the state asking for his assistance in getting the matter resolved. | supporter: That sounds like a very positive thing to have done. I really hope that they pay some attention to you. This situation is not your fault! | seeker: I have been to this food bank once before, and they actually made me feel very comfortable and welcomed and gave me an information package on other ways the parent organization may be able to assist me. | supporter: Yes they are run by lovely people. Ours gave us a pamphlet for cheap and easy to make recipes too. | seeker: I am very lucky in that the organization is only 3 miles from me. I will be looking into their rent assistance and employment assistance programs as well. | supporter: So, at least it sounds like you have a good handle on this and are doing everything you can to help yourself, am I right? | seeker: I have an advantage because I have a professional background in cooking, so I can take random ingredients and turn them into wonderful and nutritious meals. I just need to have the ingredients. | supporter: That sounds very encouraging! It's amazing what you can make even with cheap food. Noodles , for instance, are very versatile :) | seeker: You are right. I am definitely not going to sit and pout. I am just a bit frustrated with the system. | supporter: It's a very strange situation and I suspect that some of the authorities just feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to cope. | seeker: I am concerned that my boss may try to not take me back at my job. Because this is an "at will" state, he can terminate me without cause. Although he can not legally fire me for being ill with COVID, he can take me back and simply release me the same day saying that I have become redundant.

I'm sure I'm not the only one with no plans this weekend, though. | supporter: True but I can understand that, it is hard being alone at the holidays. | supporter: Did you have plans this weekend? | seeker: No. My nearby friends all went away for the holidays. I could probably just occupy my time with things I need or want to do in order to distract myself. | supporter: What kind of hobbies do you have? | seeker: I'm teaching myself the piano. I'm also teaching myself how to work a stenography machine for possible future employment as a stenographer. I also like to read novels. | supporter: I have never understood how those work..I find it amazing someone can type out whole words or sentences with one word | seeker: Yeah, it's pretty cool. For example, if I hit DRAT in one stroke, then "Did there come a time" will appear in English on my machine's LCD screen. | supporter: Wow that is crazy, I don't understand how that works, is it preprogrammed or does it go by how the word sounds? | seeker: Each stenographer has their own "Personal Dictionary" which is a list of words in English along with how you in particular write out those words or phrases in steno. This dictionary is present within the actual steno machine after you transfer it from your laptop to the machine via cable or wifi. Thus your machine then knows how you write out words in particular and how to translate those words from steno to English - each stenographer writes a little differently. | supporter: OK that makes sense, so you basically program it as the user. I take it your stenography machine becomes pretty close to you lol

No, it's happened before, being along for the holidays; but you've helped to cheer me up, so thanks! | supporter: No problem, I hope I have made your day a little better! | seeker: You have, thanks!

## Evaluation 87 (ID: 88)

### Context
**Situation:** My ex partner is harassing me and will not stop talking to my friends and family.

**Conversation:** seeker: Hello | supporter: Hi! How are you today? | seeker: I have been better | supporter: It sounds like you might be upset. Can you tell me what’s going on? | seeker: My ex partner and I broke up a long time ago because they cheated on me. Now they will not stop contacting my friends and family and posting about me on social media | supporter: That sounds difficult and stressful. What do you do when you see it happening? | seeker: I usually just document it and try to not go online for a while. It is hard to ignore | supporter: It sounds like you are avoiding things you enjoy because of their actions. I think documenting it is a good idea! Have you tried reporting them for harassing you? | seeker: I have tried but everyone just tells me there is nothing they can do because they don't think it is dangerous or criminal at this point | supporter: That must be very frustrating. Can you tell me if you’ve tried other things to get them to stop? | seeker: I have confronted them in person but it was dramatic to say the least. They basically had a meltdown that they don't want to lose me | supporter: You tried to do the right thing and they are having a difficult time letting go. The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, I had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, I asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and I realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter. Would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions? | seeker: I have encouraged my friends to block them as well, but a new account always pops up. My ex really will not give up.

## Evaluation 129 (ID: 130)

### Context
**Situation:** I have been recently laid out because of COVID-19 and not solved yet.

**Conversation:** supporter: Hello. | seeker: I am looking for another job preferably in my locality and not getting yet, since last 2 months. I will find it difficult to sustain if this continues like this for other 3 months. | supporter: So it sounds like you've been struggling with finding a new job. It's never easy looking for a new job during these times. Why do you think you're having trouble? | seeker: Getting a job is not that difficult. But I try to find a job in my locality to avoid distant from family and having food issues. | supporter: It sounds like you're motivated and dealing with a lot. Is there a specific job that you had in mind or are you applying to different kinds of jobs? | seeker: Any kind of job, probably managerial. But to be in my locality since to look after my aged mom also. | supporter: It sounds like you really care to want to be close to home. Have you talked with someone locally about jobs that would allow you to stay close to home? | seeker: I have been talking to some people who my friends knows also. They show interest but cannot help me on the issue. | seeker: Surely they will refer to some people. But it will take some time. | supporter: Stay motivated. If one opportunity doesn't get your desired response you may be even closer to finding the right job for you. Keep pushing on and know that if one opportunity doesn't work out a positive attitude will make all the difference. Just because you haven't found one yet doesn't mean you won't. | seeker: Thanks for making confidence. I feel relaxed. I believe this will surely be a chance to find myself and get a better opportunity to be relieved from my previous difficulties. Only GOD should have forced me this way, I believe. | supporter: Your faith is healthy and gives you purpose. Similarly you have to believe that the dots will connect in your favor. Maybe you can't connect them looking forward, but looking backwards you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. | seeker: I felt anger over my previous employer since he was not giving any time for me to switch over, at least 2 months. | seeker: Even then he was satisfied till then. | supporter: It can be frustrating to focus on your last job, especially if you haven't found a new one yet. Perhaps once you find a new job your disappointment with the last one won't be so disappointing anymore. If the new job is better you wouldn't have found it working the last job. | seeker: Anyhow my loyalty was not encouraged to perform more. I have to move from some back again. | seeker: Any I am preparing myself better, using the break time to gain my knowledge further and sharpen my skills, reading and viewing many articles in the net and youtube. I helps me a lot. | supporter: It's great that you're staying productive and improving yourself. If your desire to improve yourself is as strong as your desire to find a new job I'm confident you will. | seeker: It helps me to forget the past and concentrate on the future. | supporter: Don't let your past define you, let your present choices pave a new path into the future. | seeker: I am going forward only. I think I am very close to the treasure, not knowing how many hits to dig. | seeker: I require your greetings for a better prospectus. . | supporter: I'm confident you will.

**Situation:** My significant other has started to become distant and I fear our relationship is over.

**Conversation:** supporter: Hi, how are you doing? | seeker: Hello. I suppose I could be doing better. | supporter: Anything in particular you're having a hard time with? | seeker: Yep. Thanks for asking. It feels to me like my GF and I may be breaking up. | supporter: I'm sorry, I've been in that position before. Do you feel it's for the best? | seeker: No. I am very sad about it. She recently informed me shes going to go a graduate school far away after I made the decision to come to school near where she lives. | supporter: That's really hard, especially when there's chance it could have worked out if it wasn't for the distance. Do you regret choosing to go to the school near where she lives? | seeker: Yes. I feel like I put my life on hold for someone else only to have them throw me to the curve. | supporter: Definitely feeling like you're living for someone else and having them not do the same is hurtful. Although it seems like you're the one in the relationship who is willing to make more sacrifices | seeker: At this point, yes. | seeker: I just wish we would of talked about this a year ago when I uprooted my life the first time. | seeker: I fear that this will continue to happen. | supporter: Oh ok then it's not the first time this has happened. | supporter: I think you might be right, if you notice a pattern then it might continue to happen | seeker: So you think this will continue to happen? | supporter: Most likely, she seems to need space to live for herself and is less willing to make sacrifices for you like you do for her | supporter: But even it won't happen again, you shouldn't have to live worrying that it will

**Situation:** My best friend finally stopped showing up and stopped replying to my message.

**Conversation:** supporter: Hello! How can I encourage you today? | supporter: Hello! How can I encourage you today? | supporter: Sorry that posted twice! :o | seeker: Hey so my best friend finally stopped showing up. We're growing apart... | supporter: You are growing apart from your best friend? Is this a good thing or not a good thing? Or you aren't sure? | seeker: It's an expected thing but it's sad. We have hurt each other many times and he is a daily drug user and is very much a fair weather friend. | supporter: Ouch! That is a sad thing. As I was sitting here thinking about friends I have moved on from, sadly, most of the time it was for the best, even though it hurt at the time. | seeker: My friend stopped showing up when he said he would and I slowly stopped answering his calls and texts. | supporter: Life is a journey, and as we walk toward goals in our life, people either join us or bring us down. Sometimes they only walk on the path we are on for a short time, sometimes longer. I have very few friends from High School, 2 to be exact. And only on FB, that was back in 1979 too. lol I'm old, but I have had to move on from destructive relationships, as you are doing now. It can be hard. | seeker: This is so strange and wonderful connecting with a stranger about this! Wow. That's true. I kept trying to get my friends clean and to work on a hobby with me but drugs destroyed my two best friends and killed one of them. | supporter: Ouch! That sounds hard. I had friends like that too. I had to walk away. Has your friend asked you why you are ignoring him? The reason I ask this is because it's good to get some closure and let them know their behavior is destructive and you need space from that. | seeker: No, he seemed to respond with pride. He deleted his facebook and never talked to me again after that. | supporter: I have learned in life that unhealthy people run from problems, healthy people stick in the mud with you and try to work out issues.

It was one of the most painful experiences of my life. | seeker: I think she liked all of the attention he was giving her, and then she got turned on by it. It is sick. | seeker: I can't believe anyone would ever leave you, you seem like such a nice person. | supporter: Maybe she did like the attention, but that is her own issue. It really doesn't have anything to do with you. | supporter: Sometimes low self worth makes a person seek that kind of exterior validation from someone else. | seeker: I should have followed and stalked her like this guy did, it seems to turn her on, she said she likes being watched. I told her to see a therapist and she told me to leave our apartmnent. | supporter: That doesn't sound healthy to you, does it? | seeker: Yes, I think she has low self esteem, but she let me do things with her, we would experiment sexually together, it was wild. | seeker: But now I think she is not healthy and has mental issues.

**Conversation:** seeker: Hello, how are you doing today? | supporter: Im okay how are you? | seeker: I am glad you are doing okay, I am struggling with my current employer which has brought me an area of anger and sadness. | supporter: Oh no, that's not good. I understand how you feel there. I can definately relate to that...What's going on? | seeker: My employer is great, I work for a local hospital as a house keeper technician, but my department is poorly observed by HR and corporate. I have been excelling in my role and went from part time employee with no benefits at 40hrs a week, but since I have a applied for our security team I was denied because I took the full time position and have to wait another 4 months. I have already worked in this position for 7 months. | supporter: So you applied for the Security Team and was denied because of your full time position with the same company? | seeker: Correct, when I took the position my manager said that I could transfer after six months. I felt lied to and the micromanaging and high turn overstaff due to my supervisor has me on that same boat now. I feel like my only option is to quit. HR was the one who delivered the transfer denial. | supporter: Wow, that is crazy that is going on, it doesn't seem fair at all...

### Context
**Situation:** I have a ton of tests and projects all due very soon and it is during a time in which I had not seen any friends and am feeling down. I feel very overwhelmed and sad.

**Conversation:** supporter: Hello there! How can I encourage you today? | seeker: Hi, I have been going through a lot of stress with school and am also sad and lonely as of late and not sure how to make myself feel better | supporter: So you have had a lot of stress with school lately and are struggling to keep yourself cheerful? | supporter: Is there something in particular at school that is stressing you out? Exams? Relationships? | seeker: Yes! Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well. | seeker: Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough. | supporter: I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now? | seeker: I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot | supporter: Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that. | supporter: For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. | supporter: I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much. | seeker: Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? | seeker: I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating. | supporter: Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule. | seeker: Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school. | supporter: Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. | supporter: Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments. | seeker: Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break | seeker: I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe. | supporter: Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books. | supporter: Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing.

Have you had any contact with her since? | seeker: Only once and she was just telling me that I was a horrible person. | seeker: This all started over her stopping her meds and then I asked her to clean her room. | supporter: That sounds very toxic. Is it possible to persuade her to seek medical help? I realise she might be reluctant to | seeker: We have tried to get her into therapy again. But, COVID put a block on that. | seeker: I suggested that she go back to the ward and maybe be placed into a group home. | supporter: Ah yes, it is a terrible time at the moment isn't it? I think a lot of people are not getting the medical help that they need because of the virus | supporter: Please do not beat yourself up over this - it does sound as though you have done absolutely everything you could to help. | seeker: I would hate to see that happen, but Im at my wits end. | supporter: I can tell that you feel really bad about this just from your tone of voice. Please remember that you can't fix everything in the world. | seeker: Now my dads side of the family hates me because they say Im "mean to her". All I asked her to do was to clean her room and maybe socialize every once in a while. | seeker: Im more mad than sad. | supporter: Socialising can be hard for people with mental health problems. It might have been best if you did not press her too hard to do that though I know you did not realise. | seeker: I understand, but I think it would have better than sitting in a dark room all day.

I think most of us do but just don't speak up about it. Also being away from your friends and family can cause feelings of doubt because you may not feel like you have trusted ones to lean on. However | supporter: You should try to take some time out of each day to instead of question yourself to congratulate yourself, because you are doing tough things on your own but hey youre DOING IT! | seeker: Do you have any tips on how to deal with headaches or being overly stressed or anxious? | supporter: For anxiety and stress i would sugesst taking time out away from all your chores and tasks and just be to yourself. What is something you enjoy? May a cup of tea or an episode of the office. You always have to take a moment for yourself | seeker: So something like going for a run, or watching a funny movie? | supporter: Meditation, yoga, a warm bath these things can also be soothing as well. SOmetimes using kinectic energy up can help as well like going for a brisk walk to burn off the adrenaline that causes anxiety | seeker: Thank you for the ideas | seeker: But what if you get so stressed you can't really think of anything else? | supporter: Yes! Heck go all out and do both is you have a treadmill ha ha ! do what makes YOU happy even if just for a moment | supporter: IF your stress has become that high, then you go ahead and aknowledge the anxiety that is flowing through you. Give it you attention and close your eyes and start to ask yourself what is the root of what is scaring me. What is the official thoing i am afrad of or worried about. When our thoughts begin to race its hard to focus and we make mistakes and that adds to the stress. | seeker: Thank you so much, your advice will be really helpful!

How are you doing today? | seeker: I'm doing alright, I'm facing a lot of academic pressure from my program and I feel trapped | supporter: Oh, it sounds like you are stressed from the academic pressure that you are facing right now? | seeker: Yes, I have a lot of coursework but I have no help from from my advisors. A few of my peers feel the same way. Not sure what to do. I don't believe remote learning is helpful in a master program because the professor/advisor are not always available. | supporter: I see how this can be stressful for you and your fellow peers. Have you tried other steps besides the one's you tried before by contacting the professor? | seeker: I tried, but the coursework is difficult and the other solution is tutorials on youtube but there is so much you can do on your own. Plus I have a job as well, so limited hours | supporter: I can relate to this because it is hard to work and do school as well. I can tell it makes you feel concerned about your schooling and you want to do the best you can. | seeker: I wish so, do your best and hope for the best I guess. | supporter: You are doing great I believe and really trying hard to do your schoolwork right. | seeker: I just need to deal with the stress so it doesnt effect me

Plus, the student loan costs are atrocious. | supporter: I understand that college can be financially demanding. | seeker: It is a rip off for what you get..... | seeker: Hopefully, my student loans will be forgiven by President Joe Biden in 2021 | seeker: My anxiety is from the costs of college as well. | supporter: You need to think that you will have a secure job once you graduate, and every debt will be eventually paid off even if Biden doesn't forgive it. | supporter: Try to remain optimistic and shake away the anxiety, it won't do you any good. | seeker: Yeah, but big debts are big debts

He said to my aunt "sorry for your loss" My aunt said "oh, she's right over there and alive" | seeker: the car accident was so bad the tow truck guy thought I had died | seeker: but even after seeing my car, friends and family acted like it was just something that happens to everyone. walk it off | supporter: Wow, I can't imagine what the car must have looked like then for such a comment to be made. I'm glad that you here and despite going through that trauma that you are still going. | seeker: Thanks. | supporter: A women fell asleep at the wheel in 2013 and hit me going through an intersection and totaled by car as well, but I had only had a concussion and pain I had to go to physical therapy for a short time, so I can't imagine how you must have felt. | seeker: What are some things you do when you have depression? Have you been in a scary car accident before or know anyone? Have you offered them kindness or you just dismissed them and thought it was their own problem? | seeker: That sounds scary. And is extremely unfortunate. | supporter: I'm sorry that you didn't get the support you needed after your accidents because it's hard enough to go through the pain and trauma (mental and physical) to begin with and the support is much needed. | seeker: Absolutely! But I'm doing better now. You find out who your real friends and family are and you move on. The whole saying of "they don't deserve you at your best when they weren't there when you were at your worst"

**Conversation:** supporter: Hi, are you having a good day at the moment? | seeker: Today is okay, i guess. I'm just stressed. | supporter: Is there a general problem that you would like to talk about? I am more than happy to listen. | seeker: Yes, I found out I didnt pass college algebra and my academic advisor is pressuring me to take the class over this winter break in order to graduate on time. | seeker: But I have been in new york city all year and my parents just got me tickets to fly home | seeker: I really miss them | supporter: I am sorry to hear that but try not to panic, just failing one class is not the end of the world. How do you feel about retaking it? | seeker: I don't mind retaking it, really | supporter: Ah so you feel that this is going to be severely disruptive to your plans for this winter break? | seeker: yha. also, im worried i might fail again if i get too distracted by my family | supporter: Is it possible for you to get any sort of private tutoring which might help you? | seeker: i mean, tutoring is just another added time commitment. I really failed the first time because i was depressed and unmotivated. which is why I'm excited to be with my family finally | supporter: Ah .. in that case is it possible to talk to your doctor? They might be able to get a special allowance for you given your personal circumstances | seeker: yeah. that's another thing. I havent told my therapist or even my parents yet | seeker: that i failed | supporter: I think that it would be a really good idea if you talked to them about it. They will probably be a lot more understanding than you might think | seeker: what if they're disappointed | supporter: If they love you, and I am sure that your family do, then they will accept what has happened without criticism | seeker: how do i even begin to start the conversation | supporter: Well, do you have any siblings that you are close to and that you could tell first? | seeker: yeah i told my twin sister, actually

**Conversation:** seeker: Not a great day. | supporter: How is your day going today? Do you have anything on your mind? | seeker: It is not a good day.... | supporter: I am sorry to hear that - so life is not great at the moment? Would you like to tell me more? | seeker: Maybe. It is tough to talk about right now. | supporter: I understand. I know how hard it can be to open up about what is worrying you. I've been in that position too. | seeker: I love my girl, but she decided to break up with me......by text message, | seeker: I get no respect..... | supporter: Oh I am so sorry! That is a really unpleasant thing to do to someone, especially at this time of year. | seeker: Yeah, it is. | supporter: Is there anyone close to you that you can talk to about this? Friends? | seeker: I am disgusted that my girl did that to me......And by text message???! What the F--- | seeker: My friends came up to me in the bar and said they had heard about the breakup.... | supporter: Yes it is a very cowardly thing to do. I am quite disgusted that she did not have the courage to talk to you face to face too. You have every right to feel angry. | seeker: Some friends to gossip....yeah, I am disgusted for sure, | seeker: We had been together over 2 years.... | supporter: Unfortunately there are people out there who are not true friends and who just want something to talk about. I have experienced that myself. | seeker: Yeah, I bet many have. It is not a very Civil society. | seeker: Very uncivil method of breaking up.... | supporter: It really is not is it! I can tell how upset you feel just from talking to you, and also that the method of the break up is really sore point. | seeker: It just disgusts me how gauche my girl's method was. Maybe people should be more polite about how they communicate about something like breaking up. | supporter: It could be that you are better off without her? If she has such bad manners then I think that you cn do better. | seeker: That is a great point. A rather gauche move on her part, dontcha think? | seeker: Have you ever had someone dump you?? | supporter: Yes I do. I would not personally do that to someone even if I was unhappy in relationship. | seeker: Yeah, I hear you. | supporter: Yes I have been dumped. We had been together for eight years and he left me for another woman. | seeker: I feel disgusted so much that I got played "like an old fiddle." It sucks..... | supporter: I know how you are feeling but I think that you need to get professional help to move on. Are you able to go to therapy? | seeker: I haven't thought about getting therapy. What would help? | supporter: Well, I think it could be really beneficial to let your anger out | seeker: I am glad to be able to vent to you about my girl's actions. I hope she is not going to hook up with my "wing man,' Rick. I would be filled with even more disgust.

**Conversation:** seeker: Hey. | seeker: I am really scared about my job prospects. | seeker: I am really fearful about my job situation. | supporter: When did this fear start? | seeker: It has been a while. | seeker: I have had fears going back to my childhood traumas. | seeker: I think that the work situation has only exacerbated that. | seeker: The current economic climate has really made me fearful....not sure if I am going to be able to keep my job. | supporter: It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct? | seeker: Somewhat. But, my fears are relevant because I don't know if I will always have a job. | supporter: Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? A relative or a close peer at your job? | seeker: Do you know what I mean? | seeker: What say u? | seeker: I have some, but they have their own problems to deal with. Everyone has problems. | seeker: Do you know what I mean? | supporter: You know, I once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but I took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me. | seeker: It is making me have flashbacks of other traumatic situations, | seeker: I think I need to find a good support chain, for sure. | seeker: What say u? | seeker: You take alooonnng time to respond. | supporter: There are many counselors who specialize in this field of job security and especially during this pandemic and the falling economy, they are great support systems. | seeker: I am having a hard time.... | seeker: Ok, I will look some of them online. I need some financial planners to help as well. Many Americans are hurting. | supporter: If you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative. Just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic. | seeker: Any other advices? | seeker: What else can you advise me on? | seeker: Should I look elsewhere for jobs? | seeker: I will have to try that. Maybe it can help me ease my mind. | supporter: Since a lot of this stress is being caused by your childhood trauma, it seems like there is something that connects that job to your trauma and if it cant be disconnected, it seems like you should find another job. | supporter: And I understand that is not the easiest in these times but I believe you can do it! | seeker: It is not easy right now. That's for sure. | seeker: I am wondering if I could do Lyft or Uber. | seeker: I think a side hustle could work, perhaps?

Is there anything you'd like to talk about today? | seeker: Going through a break-up. My 3rd one this year.... | seeker: Nice to meet you too | seeker: It suckssssss | supporter: Gosh you've been busy :). I am sorry to hear that though - I know how much it hurts when you split with someone, especially if it was not consensual. | supporter: It's a lousy time of year for it too, isn't it? | seeker: I feel like a piece of crap, and childish at that. I can't maintain any of my relationships. I think I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life. | supporter: That is a defeatist way to talk! Just because a couple of relationships fail does not mean that you will never be able to find happiness. | seeker: Well, if past experience has any powers of prediction. I get super clingy, and do this push and pull thingy, where I break up and call them names, and then become so embarrassed it's hard to even bring it up. my last boyfriend said he thought i had borderline disorder | supporter: I have been in that position too. I hate it when I realise that I am not being rational but I can't seem to stop myself sometimes and this has sometimes let to problems with my inter personal relationships | seeker: Yea, that definitely seems to be part of my problem. I really thought he was different, too. And when he broke up with me, I tried to get him to spend the night with me in a hotel, and I felt so pathetic because I was practically begging for sex | seeker: I think I am an addict. | supporter: I hear you on that one too! It's horrible to feel that you are losing your self respect but I suspect that we've all done it at some point. Have you considered getting some counselling? | seeker: Sigh.. yes. I have seen several. I also take meds from a psychiatrist. | supporter: I hear you saying that they are not really effective, is that true? | seeker: Well... one told me that I should be put down like a dog to my face. | seeker: so, yea | supporter: Okay .. I hope you reported him!! | seeker: I didn't. I was younger then. who knows. not gonna lie. maybe they're right. Sometimes I think I'm a psycho. My last therapist was always doing deep breathing exercises. It didn't help. | seeker: I also have a lot of anxiety. A LOT! | seeker: I even got an emotiona support dog

How should I approach him to communicate better? | supporter: I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you....even after work. | seeker: okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. | supporter: Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. | supporter: Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. | seeker: That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. | supporter: You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign.

**Conversation:** seeker: Hello, I'm feeling a lot of anxiety. | supporter: I am sorry to hear that. Do you know what may be causing ytour anxiety? | seeker: I found out I'm losing my job on January 1. | supporter: You lost your job? thats a tough situation. Is it due to covid? | seeker: No, not due to covid. It's a gig job, much like mturk, but the company is dropping people from my state on that date. | supporter: I know its tough especially with the holidays and all. You have so many great skills and are such a hard worker I dont think you will have a problem at all finding something different. | seeker: I've been looking at other companies, but learning a new system after all these years is difficult. | supporter: I remember a time I lost my job and felt my whole world crumbling but then I realized when one door closes another door opens. when those doors close it seems that its usually for the best because it opens the path for something bigger and greater for you. | seeker: That's true. I've thought about looking into new fields. | supporter: Have you looked into some evening classes or maybe online schooling? I hear there are so many different options when it comes to online learning. | seeker: I was looking into that last night, but with covid, classes have had to cut enrollment and are already full for next semester. | supporter: They are full? well what about surrounding towns? Have you sat down and really thought about your passions and what you enjoy doing? Maybe theres an elderly person who needs some companionship or something like that in town for the time being. | seeker: I don't have a car, so I'm stuck doing classes locally. I think I'll just have to wait for the next semester.

What seems to be the issue? | seeker: I don't have close friends because I don't trust people | supporter: You said you generally don't trust family or people in general? | seeker: people in general, I do trust certain family members | supporter: Just people who are close to you? | seeker: no, I have a hard time trusting people i don't know in order to make friends | supporter: I have had a hard time trusting strangers, but that is not a big problem. | supporter: I used to be the same way, but I learned about how to make and keep close friends. | seeker: i think it feels like a problem because I never let anyone too close in order to make friends and have an external support system | seeker: how did you do it | supporter: I joined volunteer groups to help others. I made friends with like-minded people who volunteered to make a difference. | seeker: I actually think that is a great idea. I have never thought of doing that for that specific purpose. | supporter: Groups like Habitat for Humanity or UNICEF will help you to build long-lasting friendships. | supporter: It just takes finding the right volunteer groups and being willing to be pro-active. | seeker: I guess it makes a lot of sense. If you go to a party or a bar, you don't know what you will get, as it is a mixed bag of personalities. Whereas if you go to something like what you suggested then you already know that the people you meet have the same kind of heart. | supporter: You can do it. I have faith that you can use volunteering as the right method. | seeker: Thank you for that suggestion, that is really helpful and something that I will take with me from now on. | supporter: Exactly, volunteering is a great option. And there are many organizations to join.

So you are saying that you are not sure what career to study? | seeker: I do have an idea about it but I am anxious about choosing wrong and boxing myself into something I wish I hadn't chosen | supporter: Even if you chose wrong, you will generally have plenty of time to make up your mind and choose something that you really like : ), plus, you can reach out to academic advisors, for example. | seeker: I suppose you're right, I think I don't have confidence in myself that what ever I do choose, I will be good at it. Good enough to make a life out of it. | seeker: fear of failing myself because i lose interest in things over time | supporter: I myself lose interest in many things quite frequently. | seeker: but what if that thing is your career choice? | supporter: That is a totally normal aspect of human nature. It's normal to get bored of things even if we really liked them at some point | supporter: Of course, some topics like those are more serious, but as I said, even if you chosed wrong ,you can always change your major. | seeker: I guess thats right. All I care about is helping others so as long as the choice i make supports that then it will be fine. | seeker: thank you for your help | supporter: No problem, and it's great that you like helping others. | supporter: I am a firm believer that ultimately making others happy is what makes us happy. | seeker: yes, it is very rewarding to do so, it should be a part of everyone's life choices | seeker: i agree with you on that | supporter: Remember to always keep a positive mindset. I am sure you will sort this out in no time.

**Situation:** I am currently studying for an exam that I need to do for work.

**Conversation:** seeker: Hello | supporter: Hello! How can I help you today? | seeker: I am anxious about an upcoming test. | supporter: It's normal to feel nervous whenever we have an important assessment coming. | supporter: I myself would always be really anxious whenever I had any finals back in college. | seeker: Yes I have a bunch of courses that I need to do for my work, it certainly keeps me busy. | supporter: I would suggest that you study as much as you can. The more prepared you are for that test, the more manageable you will find it and the less stressed you will feel. | seeker: Yes I am pretty good about that but it just kills my free time because I am working full time. | supporter: I understand. However, you need to be able to find some time dedicated to your school activities. You are the one who needs to decide how to insert it in your schedule. | seeker: Yes honestly I am the main driver behind me doing all this schooling it is just going to be good for my career and I don't just want to stand still. | supporter: I agree, once you have your career set up you won't have to worry about working and studying anymore. You will be doing what you like for a good living. Think about the future. | seeker: That is certainly the plan | supporter: Just remember not to stress too much about it. It's just one test at the end of the day, you can do this! | seeker: Yes I am not super worried about it it is more the stress from not having free time, also insurance textbooks are not extremely exciting. | supporter: I know that I told you to try to fit school time into your schedule, but the same goes with leisure time for yourself. Find an activity that you enjoy and try to dedicate at least an hour a day to it, be it exercising, playing videogames, reading a book. | seeker: Yes that is good advice, I try to find time for myself but time seems to disappear sometimes | supporter: Happens to all of us. I myself sometimes get too invested in work and the days go by without me realizing it, but it should definetely be a priority. Try to maximize your efficiency so you can do your work while having more time for other activities. | seeker: That is helpful, I am just glad I will have a few days off after today | supporter: That's absolutely great, make good use of them (^_^)

Sometimes that can happen when you look back on yourself. | supporter: What is making you angry about the past? | seeker: I am angry I trusted my ex partner. They cheated on me and tried to hide it for months. | supporter: I can personally relate to that myself. I have went through something similar like that 4 years ago. It can be very frustrating when it happens. | seeker: What do you do when you are reminded of that situation or think about the person? | supporter: The easiest thing that I did in my situation was obtained a new hobby. I took my anger out on my ex by joining Crossfit and interacted with that community. It helped me take my mind of from my ex. | seeker: I've seen that Crossfit helps a lot of people. That is a good idea but it is kind of intimidating | supporter: Crossfit may not be for everyone, but do you think a new hobby may help you? Have you taken one in recently? | seeker: I have recently started painting and it is very relaxing | supporter: Painting is an excellent hobby. I can see that it's relaxing as well as help put your emotions into something physical. | seeker: Yes. I usually do it while listening to podcasts. It is a great distraction | supporter: It sounds like that you are doing great with your hobby. Have you try to interact with anyone else, such as an art community or your friends on your feedback? | seeker: I have but not many of my friends have been in the position I was or understand how I feel | supporter: Yea, I can see why that may make you feel alone in that aspect. I thought about that myself, but there are groups that can help you out. Strangers in fact. I went on Reddit to express my frustrations and it can help to just let out your anger. | seeker: Personally I've heard that Reddit can be really toxic | supporter: It can be, but seeing several posts in their groups, most offer advice or at least sympathy. It is kind of like what we are doing right now to be honest. Again, it is not for everyone, but it does offer a group to talk to during this pandemic lol. | seeker: I guess I can at least try it. | seeker: Thanks for all the great advice
