Is it snowing by you? | supporter: Merry Christmas! | seeker: thats great and no its not snowing its very cold thow | seeker: merry christmas to you also | supporter: How can I help you today? | seeker: im having some issues with friends not actually being friends | supporter: I hear you are having trouble figuring out which friends are really your friends and which ones aren't. Is that about right? | seeker: yes | supporter: I understand that... Did something happen that makes you feel like that? | seeker: yes their is no communication or interaction between me and them nobody answers phone calls txt messages etc | supporter: Is this a significant other? | seeker: no friends | supporter: Are they ignoring you? | seeker: when we where younger we all hung out all the time now that we are older its like they talk with each other im not sure if i did anything or not | supporter: Are you sure they are okay? Or not away with family for the holidays? | seeker: it doesnt matter they still keep open communication with each other | supporter: That's no good what do you think the problem is? | seeker: I believe its because I am the friend that has financial trouble and normally needs to borrow money | supporter: Do you owe someone already? | seeker: no anything i owe i always pay back | seeker: perhaps they are tired of being asked | supporter: That can get in the way of a friendship sometimes, but I try not to get ahead of myself and  jump the gun. They may have lost a phone or something may have come up... | supporter: That very well could be... Are you working? | seeker: no im not currently | seeker: I also think sometimes to myself that they don't answer because they think I'm asking for money | supporter: I see, Have you tried for unemployment? | seeker: yes i dont qualify | supporter: I understand that. What if that is the case? You may need to talk to them and let them know how you feel about that. | supporter: How long has this been going on? | seeker: I'm nervous about asking them why | seeker: and it happens on and off like when they feel lie it i guess i will say maybe 4 months | supporter: I understand that, but if you want to get to a point that you feel better about it then you will have to speak to them. | seeker: yes i know i hope everything be immediately resolved and not lead into other problems and end of friendshps | supporter: Do you see them everyday? | supporter: I understand that, are you able to go over there. | seeker: no i dont live in the same city anymore | seeker: when i go out of town i can visit but with covid19  rules | supporter: Well I can see that you have put the effort in to try and keep the relationship so it sounds like the ball is in their court if they want to do the same. | seeker: yes | supporter: Well that is about all that can be done and wait for them to come around...Do you have  any hobbies? | seeker: yes i like to read and play music | supporter: I like to go on runs every morning. It helps to clear my mind and makes it easier to brush things off when they bother me. | supporter: What instrument do you play? | seeker: my sister goes on runs in the morning time and says it relax her for the day i think i migh | seeker: i played the piano when i was in highschool | supporter: It is a really good stress reliever. I played when I  was younger, didn't ever get very good. Did you? | seeker: no i didn't i had to stop because i have what the doctors call a trigger finger it caused great pain when i would practice | supporter: Hmm, well maybe take some more lessons, We can always strive to be better at everything we do. | seeker: yes that is true | supporter: Maybe take a run in order to clear your mind. | supporter: I'm sure they will come around. | seeker: i think i would start off walking i am not in shape to run | seeker: yes i will give them time maybe stop reaching out so much | supporter: That may be a good idea. Good talk | seeker: yes thank you for talking with me and giving great advice"

Something on your mind? | seeker: I'm concerned about my job. I have been out of work for the past 5 weeks because I tested positive for COVID-19. | supporter: Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? | supporter: Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? | supporter: (sorry for duplication, not sure what happened there!) | seeker: It just keeps getting better...  I applied for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and was approved.  The next day, I got an email asking me to verify my identity (I am fine with that.  It actually makes good sense.)... | supporter: So you have been getting some assistance? | seeker: So I did as instructed and got the message on the website thanking me for verification.  The following week I got a physical letter saying I was approved and the award amount per week. | seeker: I have gone online once a week and qualified, as one is supposed to do, and still I have not received a cent. | supporter: I see, so you are really financially struggling at the moment? Is there anywhere else you could apply for assistance? What about a foodbank? | seeker: Calling the customer service line is futile.  The computer just plays a recording that the agents are on other calls and then it disconnects the call. | supporter: I hear you there - I spent a long time on hold for an official matter the other day. I guess that everyone is really desperate for help and advice right now. | seeker: I have been very fortunate.  People in my church have been bringing me food.  I plan on trying to go to the food bank Monday, if they are open. | supporter: I hope that they can help you. My partner and I have used one before and they were very helpful. I felt a bit ashamed but there was no judgement at all. | seeker: I actually got so tired of redialing the Department of Labor and Training that I sent an email to the Lieutenant Governor of the state asking for his assistance in getting the matter resolved. | supporter: That sounds like a very positive thing to have done. I really hope that they pay some attention to you. This situation is not your fault! | seeker: I have been to this food bank once before, and they actually made me feel very comfortable and welcomed and gave me an information package on other ways the parent organization may be able to assist me. | supporter: Yes they are run by lovely people. Ours gave us a pamphlet for cheap and easy to make recipes too. | seeker: I am very lucky in that the organization is only 3 miles from me.  I will be looking into their rent assistance and employment assistance programs as well. | supporter: So, at least it sounds like you have a good handle on this and are doing everything you can to help yourself, am I right? | seeker: I have an advantage because I have a professional background in cooking, so I can take random ingredients and turn them into wonderful and nutritious meals.  I just need to have the ingredients. | supporter: That sounds very encouraging! It's amazing what you can make even with cheap food. Noodles , for instance, are very versatile :) | seeker: You are right.  I am definitely not going to sit and pout.  I am just a bit frustrated with the system. | supporter: It's a very strange situation and I suspect that some of the authorities just feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to cope. | seeker: I am concerned that my boss may try to not take me back at my job.  Because this is an \"at will\" state, he can terminate me without cause.  Although he can not legally fire me for being ill with COVID, he can take me back and simply release me the same day saying that I have become redundant."

What is your biggest problem at the moment? | supporter: Ah, am I to take it that a relationship has recently ended? | seeker: When we met, before we got involved, he said he was divorced. I ended up finding out that he was still legally married.

If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, I asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and I realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter.

I will find it difficult to sustain if this continues like this for other 3 months. | supporter: So it sounds like you've been struggling with finding a new job. It's never easy looking for a new job during these times. Why do you think you're having trouble? | seeker: Getting a job is not that difficult. But I try to find a job in my locality to avoid distant from family and having food issues. | supporter: It sounds like you're motivated and dealing with a lot. Is there a specific job that you had in mind or are you applying to different kinds of jobs? | seeker: Any kind of job, probably managerial. But to be in my locality since to look after my aged mom also. | supporter: It sounds like you really care to want to be close to home. Have you talked with someone locally about jobs that would allow you to stay close to home? | seeker: I have been talking to some people who my friends knows also. They show interest but cannot help me on the issue. | seeker: Surely they will refer to some people. But it will take some time. | supporter: Stay motivated. If one opportunity doesn't get your desired response you may be even closer to finding the right job for you. Keep pushing on and know that if one opportunity doesn't work out a positive attitude will make all the difference. Just because you haven't found one yet doesn't mean you won't. | seeker: Thanks for making confidence. I feel relaxed. I believe this will surely be a chance to find myself and get a better opportunity to be relieved from my previous difficulties. Only GOD should have forced me this way, I believe. | supporter: Your faith is healthy and gives you purpose. Similarly you have to believe that the dots will connect in your favor. Maybe you can't connect them looking forward, but looking backwards you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. | seeker: I felt anger over my previous employer since he was not giving any time for me to switch over, at least 2 months. | seeker: Even then he was satisfied till then. | supporter: It can be frustrating to focus on your last job, especially if you haven't found a new one yet. Perhaps once you find a new job your disappointment with the last one won't be so disappointing anymore. If the new job is better you wouldn't have found it working the last job. | seeker: Anyhow my loyalty was not encouraged to perform more. I have to move from some back again. | seeker: Any I am preparing myself better, using the break time to gain my knowledge further and sharpen my skills, reading and viewing many articles in the net and youtube. I helps me a lot. | supporter: It's great that you're staying productive and improving yourself. If your desire to improve yourself is as strong as your desire to find a new job I'm confident you will. | seeker: It helps me to forget the past and concentrate on the future. | supporter: Don't let your past define you, let your present choices pave a new path into the future. | seeker: I am going forward only. I think I am very close to the treasure, not knowing how many hits to dig. | seeker: I require your greetings for a better prospectus. . | supporter: I'm confident you will."

I am feeling pretty down right now. | supporter: How long have you not been feeling not so well? | seeker: Today was my one-year anniversary with my boyfriend. | seeker: He broke up with me today. | seeker: We were at school (our college campus), and we had a huge fight. | supporter: Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. | seeker: Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don't know what to do with myself. | supporter: Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. | seeker: I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. | seeker: That's true, but that doesn't make me feel any better about it right now. | supporter: It's really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. | seeker: Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. | supporter: Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? | seeker: I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. | seeker: I suppose I just need to practice more. | supporter: There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. | seeker: Like the Calm app? | supporter: There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. | supporter: Yes, the Calm app is one. | seeker: I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately. | seeker: What else can I do besides meditation? | supporter: You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds? | seeker: Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick. | seeker: Candles are much better for me. | supporter: There  are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil. | seeker: I haven't heard of that website before.  I'll have to check it out. | supporter: I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships. | seeker: Well, I haven't been in a long-term relationship like this before. | seeker: My past relationships were all in high school, and they only lasted a few weeks or months at a time. | seeker: I really cared for this one, and we were together for so long. | supporter: I feel obligated to help during Christmas because I had a nasty fight with my partner one year over gifts. | seeker: You had a fight with your partner?  I'm sorry, it's the worst when people fight over what's supposed to be something nice. | supporter: What was the fight over? Food? Money? Sex? | seeker: I forget what started it, it was something stupid.  He didn't like the way I said something and it kind of blew up from there. | seeker: We were fighting over the smallest things these last few months. | seeker: It just kind of built up to the point where he said he couldn't take fighting with me anymore and just wanted to end it. | supporter: I would let things decompress for a long while. | seeker: End the relationship, I mean. | seeker: You think maybe if we just take some time apart, he might want to talk about it? | supporter: I suggest thinking through ending the relationship if he has a hot temper. | seeker: He does get upset very easily. | supporter: Yes, just think it through for some time. | seeker: I do think it is important to take some time and breathe. | supporter: Was the relationship with him pleasant for many months? | seeker: Yes, for most of our time together it was wonderful. | seeker: He made me laugh very easily. | seeker: That's part of why I'm so sad that he ended the relationship. | supporter: You said it has only gotten rough in the last two months? | seeker: Two or three, yes. | seeker: And we would fight over the smallest things, it was really stupid. | supporter: You said that he has announced to you he has ended the relationship on Christmas? | supporter: Today, you mean? | seeker: Yes, and it was our one year anniversary. | seeker: We were supposed to order takeout and watch a movie and exchange presents. | seeker: Instead we fought and broke up. | supporter: In my opinion, I would consider accepting that it is not going to be a healthy relationship whatsoever. | seeker: I think you are right. | seeker: Unless we went to some sort of counseling. | seeker: But it probably is for the best. | supporter: I have seen things only get worse in a situation like yours.  I think h needs to accept that he needs to grow up. | supporter: How old are the both of you?"

I did get to talk to them over the phone that was nice. | supporter: That is good! It seems like calling on the phone can feel more genuine. Do you like playing Among Us?

How can I encourage you today? | supporter: Sorry that posted twice! :o | seeker: Hey so my best friend finally stopped showing up. We're growing apart... | supporter: You are growing apart from your best friend? Is this a good thing or not a good thing? Or you aren't sure? | seeker: It's an expected thing but it's sad. We have hurt each other many times and he is a daily drug user and is very much a fair weather friend. | supporter: Ouch! That is a sad thing. As I was sitting here thinking about friends I have moved on from, sadly, most of the time it was for the best, even though it hurt at the time. | seeker: My friend stopped showing up when he said he would and I slowly stopped answering his calls and texts. | supporter: Life is a journey, and as we walk toward goals in our life, people either join us or bring us down.  Sometimes they only walk on the path we are on for a short time, sometimes longer. I have very few friends from High School, 2 to be exact. And only on FB, that was back in 1979 too. lol I'm old, but I have had to move on from destructive relationships, as you are doing now. It can be hard. | seeker: This is so strange and wonderful connecting with a stranger about this! Wow. That's true. I kept trying to get my friends clean and to work on a hobby with me but drugs destroyed my two best friends and killed one of them. | supporter: Ouch! That sounds hard. I had friends like that too. I had to walk away. Has your friend asked you why you are ignoring him? The reason I ask this is because it's good to get some closure and let them know their behavior is destructive and you need space from that. | seeker: No, he seemed to respond with pride. He deleted his facebook and never talked to me again after that. | supporter: I have learned in life that unhealthy people run from problems, healthy people stick in the mud with you and try to work out issues."

Its very snowy and pretty here today | seeker: we got about an inch of now over the night | supporter: Well, shoveling can be good for releasing tension in the body by exercising by shoveling, even though it is short. | seeker: That's a good idea actually, I've been tracking snow in going up and down stairs, could clear a path | supporter: I like doing a little shoveling but you have to do it right, as to not wear out your back. | supporter: Do you like snow? We had a rain storm for hours on Christmas Eve. I wanted a little snow to make things look nice. | supporter: Are my suggestions helping any? | seeker: I love snow, winter is my favorite season I hate hot weather. It started christmas eve raining a ton here but it got to 15F over the night so it turned to a pretty heavy snow. | seeker: They are, helped take my mind off of the stuff I wass stresing over | supporter: Well, there are incense pots that allow you to close you eyes and feel the glow of the meditation sticks.  Certain scents can release stress. Do you have any on the home that you can burn? | seeker: I do have some incense sticks, I usually use palo santo sticks though | supporter: I have heard good things about Palo Santo sticks and rosemary / lavender oils that can calm and relax, | seeker: I think I have some rosemary essential oil actually | supporter: Do you have any music or sound effects that you can listen to as to be able to relax? | seeker: I do, have some music on currently | seeker: I love music, I'm almost always listening to something lol | supporter: I suggest rosemary oils all the time.  Getting a few quaffs can calm the nerves. | supporter: Listening to calming sound effects like running creek  water in the woods or dolphins communicating could put you in a good mood. | supporter: They say its best to stop those racing thoughts and breath in a steady pace. | seeker: I will definitely try out the roemary oil"

I think it's mainly research people. | seeker: I have applied for them but never got them.

Full mask is better than a partial mask | supporter: Yes it is! Beware that there are a lot of people trying to make money on youtube though - you need to get lucky. | seeker: Right, thanks for your advice, They do any crazy stuff to make money | supporter: It's a difficult time for us all :) People are doing what they have to in order to put food on their tables I think. | seeker: i know right, when in desperation people go crazy | supporter: I am hopeful that with the vaccine having been developed, things might start to improve shortly. | seeker: i want to be prepared before I go into that state | seeker: I hope so too\n1 | supporter: Can you think of things to look forward to in the New Year that might cheer you up a little? | seeker: oh yes the stock price may keep going up.

Is it possible to heal without finding another? | supporter: Yes I think that it is but you really do need to be kind to yourself and give it time. Do you have good friends to support you? | seeker: Many of my friends wouldn't understand as they are in long-term relationships. But yes, I've a few good friends. | supporter: That is a blessing at least though I know it can be hard to see people in happy relationships when you are single. | seeker: What did you do to cope in the first year of losing your partner\n? | supporter: I cried a lot to be honest, especially as he was happy with someone else. But I tried to focus on my work and my hobbies. It helped. | seeker: What sort of hobbies helped you? | supporter: Well I love to read. Do you have anything that you could do to help you relax  and take your mind off things? | seeker: Well, I do love to write but sometimes the \nsadness just burns me out completely and I stare at the empty page."

I understand how hard it is when you have a break up and loved ones seem to support your ex! | seeker: Has this happened to you before? | supporter: Please know that you are not alone in this situation and that there will be light at the end of the tunnel. | supporter: Yes it has .. my boyfriend left me for someone else and most of our mutual friends took his side! | seeker: I am sorry to hear that, I think your boyfriend made a big mistake leaving you, you seem like a very nice and sweet person. | supporter: Thank you :) I am sure that there is someone else out there for you too if you cannot reconcile with your ex. The question is, how much do you really want to? You might be better off without her | seeker: That might be true, she really blew it with me, I am a good catch. | supporter: That is a good way to think! Never let something like this destroy your self esteem. | seeker: I agree.  You know, you are very good at this.  Did you end up finding a new boyfriend or husband? | supporter: Yes, I am engaged now. I realise that my ex did me the biggest favour anyone ever could! | seeker: Well that is a good success story!  Thank you for the motivation. | supporter: Maybe you should think about talking to a counsellor or something about this, just to work through your feelings? | seeker: Yes I will do that.  Thank you for your support. | supporter: You are most welcome. I have a few minutes left to talk if there's anything else on your mind?"

Exams? Relationships? | seeker: Yes! Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well. | seeker: Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough. | supporter: I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now? | seeker: I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot | supporter: Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that. | supporter: For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. | supporter: I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much. | seeker: Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? | seeker: I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating. | supporter: Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule. | seeker: Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school. | supporter: Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. | supporter: Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments. | seeker: Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break | seeker: I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe. | supporter: Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books. | supporter: Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing."

So my next question where looking to find that special connection. | seeker: I've had to resort to online dating and such as there are few opportunities to meet people in person. | supporter: I understand doing that I have tried it myself and trying to find that connection is few and far between. What sites have you tried using? | seeker: Basically all of the ones you would expect. How would you suggest meeting people in person? | supporter: Well It would depend on if you were religious I  would suggest church functions for example. I use my hobbies like pool and darts and cards and join groups that creates some common ground. | seeker: That sounds like a good idea. Do you attend meetups? | supporter: I have and i usually take someone i  trust with me and if it doesnt feel right I leave. | seeker: That's good advice.

But, COVID put a block on that. | seeker: I suggested that she go back to the ward and maybe be placed into a group home. | supporter: Ah yes, it is a terrible time at the moment isn't it? I think a lot of people are not getting the medical help that they need because of the virus | supporter: Please do not beat yourself up over this - it does sound as though you have done absolutely everything you could to help. | seeker: I would hate to see that happen, but Im at my wits end. | supporter: I can tell that you feel really bad about this just from your  tone of voice. Please remember that you can't fix everything in the world. | seeker: Now my dads side of the family hates me because they say Im \"mean to her\". All I asked her to do was to clean her room and maybe socialize every once in a while. | seeker: Im more mad than sad. | supporter: Socialising can be hard for people with mental health problems.

What is something you enjoy? May a cup of tea or an episode of the office. You always have to take a moment for yourself | seeker: So something like going for a run, or watching a funny movie? | supporter: Meditation, yoga, a warm bath these things can also be soothing as well. SOmetimes using kinectic energy up can help as well like going for a brisk walk to burn off the adrenaline that causes anxiety | seeker: Thank you for the ideas | seeker: But what if you get so stressed you can't really think of anything else? | supporter: Yes! Heck go all out and do both is you have a treadmill ha ha ! do what makes YOU happy even if just for a moment | supporter: IF your stress has become that high, then you go ahead and aknowledge the anxiety that is flowing through you. Give it you attention and close your eyes and start to ask yourself what is the root of what is scaring me. What is the official thoing i am afrad of or worried about. When our thoughts begin to race its hard to focus and we make mistakes and that adds to the stress. | seeker: Thank you so much, your advice will be really helpful!"

We spend lavishly.... | seeker: Plus, I spend 50 dollars a day on lotto | supporter: Sometimes it's hard to see the other door opening when we run into tough times, but remember all the good times you have had. Those would not be good times if it were'nt for tough times. | seeker: True, but the Office was my home away from home.  I need to figure out how to deal with my sadness..... | supporter: Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times."

Have you been in a scary car accident before or know anyone? Have you offered them kindness or you just dismissed them and thought it was their own problem? | seeker: That sounds scary. And is extremely unfortunate. | supporter: I'm sorry that you didn't get the support you needed after your accidents because it's hard enough to go through the pain and trauma (mental and physical) to begin with and the support is much needed. | seeker: Absolutely! But I'm doing better now. You find out who your real friends and family are and you move on.

I've been in that position too. | seeker: I love my girl, but she decided to break up with me......by text message, | seeker: I get no respect..... | supporter: Oh I am so sorry! That is a really unpleasant thing to do to someone, especially at this time of year. | seeker: Yeah, it is. | supporter: Is there anyone close to you that you can talk to about this? Friends? | seeker: I am disgusted that my girl did that to me......And by text message???! What the F--- | seeker: My friends came up to me in the bar and said they had heard about the breakup.... | supporter: Yes it is a very cowardly thing to do. I am quite disgusted that she did not have the courage to talk to you face to face too. You have every right to feel angry. | seeker: Some friends to gossip....yeah, I am disgusted for sure, | seeker: We had been together over 2 years.... | supporter: Unfortunately there are people out there who are not true friends and who just want something to talk about. I have experienced that myself. | seeker: Yeah, I bet many have.  It is not a very Civil society. | seeker: Very uncivil method of breaking up.... | supporter: It really is not is it! I can tell how upset you feel just from talking to you, and also that the method of the break up is  really sore point. | seeker: It just disgusts me how gauche my girl's method was.  Maybe people should be more polite about how they communicate about something like breaking up. | supporter: It could be that you are better off without her? If she has such bad manners then I think that you cn do better. | seeker: That is a great point.  A rather gauche move on her part, dontcha think? | seeker: Have you ever had someone dump you?? | supporter: Yes I do. I would not personally do that to someone even if I was unhappy in  relationship. | seeker: Yeah, I hear you. | supporter: Yes I have been dumped. We had been together for eight years and he left me for another woman. | seeker: I feel disgusted so much that I got played \"like an old fiddle.\"  It sucks..... | supporter: I know how you are feeling but I think that you need to get professional help to move on. Are you able to go to therapy? | seeker: I haven't thought about getting therapy.  What would help? | supporter: Well, I think it could be really beneficial to let your anger out | seeker: I am glad to be able to vent to you about my girl's actions.  I hope she is not going to hook up with my \"wing man,' Rick.  I would be filled with even more disgust."

I need some financial planners to help as well. Many Americans are hurting. | supporter: If you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative. Just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic. | seeker: Any other advices? | seeker: What else can you advise me on? | seeker: Should I look elsewhere for jobs? | seeker: I will have to try that.  Maybe it can help me ease my mind. | supporter: Since a lot of this stress is being caused by your childhood trauma, it seems like there is something that connects that job to your trauma and if it cant be disconnected, it seems like you should find another job. | supporter: And I understand that is not the easiest in these times but I believe you can do it! | seeker: It is not easy right now.

My 3rd one this year.... | seeker: Nice to meet you too | seeker: It suckssssss | supporter: Gosh you've been busy :). I am sorry to hear that though - I know how much it hurts when you split with someone, especially if it was not consensual. | supporter: It's a lousy time of year for it too, isn't it? | seeker: I feel like a piece of crap, and childish at that. I can't maintain any of my relationships. I think I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life. | supporter: That is a defeatist way to talk! Just because a couple of relationships fail does not mean that you will never be able to find happiness. | seeker: Well, if past experience has any powers of prediction. I get super clingy, and do this push and pull thingy, where I break up and call them names, and then become so embarrassed it's hard to even bring it up. my last boyfriend said he thought i had borderline disorder | supporter: I have been in that position too. I hate it when I realise that I am not being rational but I can't seem to stop myself sometimes and this has sometimes let to problems with my inter personal relationships | seeker: Yea, that definitely seems to be part of my problem. I really thought he was different, too. And when he broke up with me, I tried to get him to spend the night with me in a hotel, and I felt so pathetic because I was practically begging for sex | seeker: I think I am an addict. | supporter: I hear you on that one too! It's horrible to feel that you are losing your self respect but I suspect that we've all done it at some point. Have you considered getting some counselling? | seeker: Sigh.. yes. I have seen several. I also take meds from a psychiatrist. | supporter: I hear  you saying that they are not really effective, is that true? | seeker: Well... one told me that I should be put down like a dog to my face. | seeker: so, yea | supporter: Okay .. I hope you reported him!! | seeker: I didn't. I was younger then. who knows. not gonna lie. maybe they're right. Sometimes I think I'm a psycho.

It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. | supporter: You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. | supporter: How old are the both of you? | seeker: Okay. I will keep that in mind. | seeker: We are 22. | supporter: Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? | seeker: Yes but less over the past few months. | supporter: Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. | supporter: I mean, the love life.  Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related....for him. | supporter: Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. | supporter: You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. | seeker: That's understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. | supporter: How do you all generally communicate? Through text? | seeker: He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends. | supporter: Which do you and your man like to communicate? | seeker: No live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person. | seeker: I communicate much more than he does. Thats why I think he is hiding something. | supporter: Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot. | seeker: You are right. I will try to be more sensitive about that. Thank you for your help. | supporter: I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you. | seeker: Do you think getting other people involved is a good idea? | supporter: I would be subtle about that tactic. | supporter: If you haven't met any of his school mates. I wouldn't pursue that option.  Have you met any of his class mates? | seeker: Yeah he has a few close friends but he is pretty to himself. We both live far away from home. | supporter: Are you and him directly off campuses in housing? You both attend the same college, correct? | seeker: Yes off campus. Same college."

My partner is cheating on me. | supporter: Cheating on you? | seeker: Yes. | seeker: With another woman. | supporter: How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? | supporter: Did he tell you that he is? | seeker: I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. | seeker: He will not admit it himself. | supporter: I am sorry if your partner is cheating. | supporter: So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? | supporter: Are you and your partner married? | seeker: Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. | seeker: We are not married but we live together. | supporter: How long have you been in a relationship with your man? | seeker: 2 years | supporter: So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. | seeker: What do you mean exactly? | supporter: Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. | seeker: I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. | supporter: Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. | seeker: That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. | supporter: I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. | seeker: Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous? | supporter: Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. | seeker: That is a good point. | supporter: Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. | supporter: Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. | seeker: I  am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. | seeker: But I appreciate your suggestions | seeker: and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile | supporter: Sure, I understand. | seeker: I should trust my partner more than any random person. | supporter: Yes, the workplace is not like home life. | supporter: Yes, trust matters. | seeker: But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? | supporter: I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work.

I've thought about looking into new fields. | supporter: Have you looked into some evening classes or maybe online schooling? I hear there are so many different options when it comes to online learning. | seeker: I was looking into that last night, but with covid,  classes have had to cut enrollment and are already full for next semester. | supporter: They are full? well what about surrounding towns? Have you sat down and really thought about your passions and what you enjoy doing?

The more prepared you are for that test, the more manageable you will find it and the less stressed you will feel. | seeker: Yes I am pretty good about that but it just kills my free time because I am working full time. | supporter: I understand. However, you need to be able to find some time dedicated to your school activities. You are the one who needs to decide how to insert it in your schedule. | seeker: Yes honestly I am the main driver behind me doing all this schooling it is just going to be good for my career and I don't just want to stand still. | supporter: I agree, once you have your career set up you won't have to worry about working and studying anymore. You will be doing what you like for a good living. Think about the future. | seeker: That is certainly the plan | supporter: Just remember not to stress too much about it. It's just one test at the end of the day, you can do this! | seeker: Yes I am not super worried about it it is more the stress from not having free time, also insurance textbooks are not extremely exciting. | supporter: I know that I told you to try to fit school time into your schedule, but the same goes with leisure time for yourself. Find an activity that you enjoy and try to dedicate at least an hour a day to it, be it exercising, playing videogames, reading a book. | seeker: Yes that is good advice, I try to find time for myself but time seems to disappear sometimes | supporter: Happens to all of us. I myself sometimes get too invested in work and the days go by without me realizing it, but it should definetely be a priority. Try to maximize your efficiency so you can do your work while having more time for other activities. | seeker: That is helpful, I am just glad I will have a few days off after today | supporter: That's absolutely great, make good use of them (^_^)"

Sometimes that can happen when you look back on yourself. | supporter: What is making you angry about the past? | seeker: I am angry I trusted my ex partner. They cheated on me and tried to hide it for months. | supporter: I can personally relate to that myself. I have went through something similar like that 4 years ago. It can be very frustrating when it happens. | seeker: What do you do when you are reminded of that situation or think about the person? | supporter: The easiest thing that I did in my situation was obtained a new hobby. I took my anger out on my ex by joining Crossfit and interacted with that community. It helped me take my mind of from my ex. | seeker: I've seen that Crossfit helps a lot of people. That is a good idea but it is kind of intimidating | supporter: Crossfit may not be for everyone, but do you think a new hobby may help you? Have you taken one in recently? | seeker: I have recently started painting and it is very relaxing | supporter: Painting is an excellent hobby. I can see that it's relaxing as well as help put your emotions into something physical. | seeker: Yes. I usually do it while listening to podcasts. It is a great distraction | supporter: It sounds like that you are doing great with your hobby. Have you try to interact with anyone else, such as an art community or your friends on your feedback? | seeker: I have but not many of my friends have been in the position I was or understand how I feel | supporter: Yea, I can see why that may make you feel alone in that aspect. I thought about that myself, but there are groups that can help you out. Strangers in fact. I went on Reddit to express my frustrations and it can help to just let out your anger. | seeker: Personally I've heard that Reddit can be really toxic | supporter: It can be, but seeing several posts in their groups, most offer advice or at least sympathy. It is kind of like what we are doing right now to be honest. Again, it is not for everyone, but it does offer a group to talk to during this pandemic lol. | seeker: I guess I can at least try it. | seeker: Thanks for all the great advice"
