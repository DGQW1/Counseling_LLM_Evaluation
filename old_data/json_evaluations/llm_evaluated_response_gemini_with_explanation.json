Something on your mind? | seeker: I'm concerned about my job. I have been out of work for the past 5 weeks because I tested positive for COVID-19. | supporter: Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? | supporter: Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access? | supporter: (sorry for duplication, not sure what happened there!) | seeker: It just keeps getting better... I applied for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and was approved. The next day, I got an email asking me to verify my identity (I am fine with that. It actually makes good sense.)... | supporter: So you have been getting some assistance? | seeker: So I did as instructed and got the message on the website thanking me for verification. The following week I got a physical letter saying I was approved and the award amount per week. | seeker: I have gone online once a week and qualified, as one is supposed to do, and still I have not received a cent. | supporter: I see, so you are really financially struggling at the moment? Is there anywhere else you could apply for assistance? What about a foodbank? | seeker: Calling the customer service line is futile. The computer just plays a recording that the agents are on other calls and then it disconnects the call. | supporter: I hear you there - I spent a long time on hold for an official matter the other day. I guess that everyone is really desperate for help and advice right now. | seeker: I have been very fortunate. People in my church have been bringing me food. I plan on trying to go to the food bank Monday, if they are open. | supporter: I hope that they can help you. My partner and I have used one before and they were very helpful. I felt a bit ashamed but there was no judgement at all. | seeker: I actually got so tired of redialing the Department of Labor and Training that I sent an email to the Lieutenant Governor of the state asking for his assistance in getting the matter resolved. | supporter: That sounds like a very positive thing to have done. I really hope that they pay some attention to you. This situation is not your fault! | seeker: I have been to this food bank once before, and they actually made me feel very comfortable and welcomed and gave me an information package on other ways the parent organization may be able to assist me. | supporter: Yes they are run by lovely people. Ours gave us a pamphlet for cheap and easy to make recipes too. | seeker: I am very lucky in that the organization is only 3 miles from me. I will be looking into their rent assistance and employment assistance programs as well. | supporter: So, at least it sounds like you have a good handle on this and are doing everything you can to help yourself, am I right? | seeker: I have an advantage because I have a professional background in cooking, so I can take random ingredients and turn them into wonderful and nutritious meals. I just need to have the ingredients. | supporter: That sounds very encouraging! It's amazing what you can make even with cheap food. Noodles , for instance, are very versatile :) | seeker: You are right. I am definitely not going to sit and pout. I am just a bit frustrated with the system. | supporter: It's a very strange situation and I suspect that some of the authorities just feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to cope. | seeker: I am concerned that my boss may try to not take me back at my job. Because this is an \"at will\" state, he can terminate me without cause. Although he can not legally fire me for being ill with COVID, he can take me back and simply release me the same day saying that I have become redundant."

He brought so much joy to my life and now that I don't have him anymore, I just feel so empty. | supporter: It is not just a dog. How insensitive of someone say that. | seeker: Well, my coworker lost his mother to COVID so I guess he is going through some tough times too. | supporter: I suggest you pretty soon adapt another dog. This might help you fill up the emptiness. | seeker: I have been trying to get out of my slump. I even thought about getting a new dog, but that just brings up sad memories. What do you think I should do? | supporter: If you are not ready to get a new dog, another thing you might try to spend some time volunteering in a dog shelter... that might give you different perspective | seeker: That actually sounds like a good idea. I hope the shelter near me will take volunteers with COVID and all. | supporter: If you are not comfortable going out due to COVID, you could involve some activities online promoting dog adaption and create awareness online and through social media.. | seeker: That's a great idea. I would love to get involved in anything related to pets. They need a loving home, especially during times like these. | seeker: Thank you for suggesting that. | supporter: Anything else I could help you with today? | seeker: No, I'll try following the advice you suggested. Hopefully, that'll help me get out of my slump. | seeker: I may even meet another dog that way too | seeker: Thank you again | supporter: Thank you. Please use \"Finish and Quit\" to end the discussion. | seeker: It says you need to send more messages?"

Exams? Relationships? | seeker: Yes! Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well. | seeker: Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough. | supporter: I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now? | seeker: I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot | supporter: Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that. | supporter: For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. | supporter: I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much. | seeker: Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? | seeker: I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating. | supporter: Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule. | seeker: Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school. | supporter: Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. | supporter: Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments. | seeker: Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break | seeker: I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe. | supporter: Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books. | supporter: Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing."

Heck go all out and do both is you have a treadmill ha ha ! do what makes YOU happy even if just for a moment | supporter: IF your stress has become that high, then you go ahead and aknowledge the anxiety that is flowing through you.

My partner is cheating on me. | supporter: Cheating on you? | seeker: Yes. | seeker: With another woman. | supporter: How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? | supporter: Did he tell you that he is? | seeker: I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. | seeker: He will not admit it himself. | supporter: I am sorry if your partner is cheating. | supporter: So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? | supporter: Are you and your partner married? | seeker: Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. | seeker: We are not married but we live together. | supporter: How long have you been in a relationship with your man? | seeker: 2 years | supporter: So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. | seeker: What do you mean exactly? | supporter: Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. | seeker: I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. | supporter: Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. | seeker: That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. | supporter: I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. | seeker: Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous? | supporter: Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. | seeker: That is a good point. | supporter: Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. | supporter: Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. | seeker: I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. | seeker: But I appreciate your suggestions | seeker: and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile | supporter: Sure, I understand. | seeker: I should trust my partner more than any random person. | supporter: Yes, the workplace is not like home life. | supporter: Yes, trust matters. | seeker: But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? | supporter: I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you....even after work. | seeker: okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. | supporter: Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. | supporter: Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. | seeker: That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. | supporter: You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. | supporter: How old are the both of you? | seeker: Okay. I will keep that in mind. | seeker: We are 22. | supporter: Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? | seeker: Yes but less over the past few months. | supporter: Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. | supporter: I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related....for him. | supporter: Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. | supporter: You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. | seeker: That's understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. | supporter: How do you all generally communicate? Through text? | seeker: He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends. | supporter: Which do you and your man like to communicate? | seeker: No live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person. | seeker: I communicate much more than he does. Thats why I think he is hiding something. | supporter: Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot. | seeker: You are right. I will try to be more sensitive about that. Thank you for your help. | supporter: I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you. | seeker: Do you think getting other people involved is a good idea? | supporter: I would be subtle about that tactic. | supporter: If you haven't met any of his school mates. I wouldn't pursue that option. Have you met any of his class mates? | seeker: Yeah he has a few close friends but he is pretty to himself. We both live far away from home. | supporter: Are you and him directly off campuses in housing? You both attend the same college, correct? | seeker: Yes off campus. Same college."
