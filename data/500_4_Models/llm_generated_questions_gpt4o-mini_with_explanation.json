I just need to have the ingredients. | supporter: That sounds very encouraging! It's amazing what you can make even with cheap food.

It's never easy looking for a new job during these times. Why do you think you're having trouble? | seeker: Getting a job is not that difficult. But I try to find a job in my locality to avoid distant from family and having food issues. | supporter: It sounds like you're motivated and dealing with a lot. Is there a specific job that you had in mind or are you applying to different kinds of jobs? | seeker: Any kind of job, probably managerial. But to be in my locality since to look after my aged mom also. | supporter: It sounds like you really care to want to be close to home.

They show interest but cannot help me on the issue. | seeker: Surely they will refer to some people. But it will take some time. | supporter: Stay motivated. If one opportunity doesn't get your desired response you may be even closer to finding the right job for you. Keep pushing on and know that if one opportunity doesn't work out a positive attitude will make all the difference. Just because you haven't found one yet doesn't mean you won't. | seeker: Thanks for making confidence. I feel relaxed. I believe this will surely be a chance to find myself and get a better opportunity to be relieved from my previous difficulties. Only GOD should have forced me this way, I believe. | supporter: Your faith is healthy and gives you purpose. Similarly you have to believe that the dots will connect in your favor. Maybe you can't connect them looking forward, but looking backwards you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. | seeker: I felt anger over my previous employer since he was not giving any time for me to switch over, at least 2 months. | seeker: Even then he was satisfied till then. | supporter: It can be frustrating to focus on your last job, especially if you haven't found a new one yet. Perhaps once you find a new job your disappointment with the last one won't be so disappointing anymore. If the new job is better you wouldn't have found it working the last job. | seeker: Anyhow my loyalty was not encouraged to perform more. I have to move from some back again. | seeker: Any I am preparing myself better, using the break time to gain my knowledge further and sharpen my skills, reading and viewing many articles in the net and youtube. I helps me a lot. | supporter: It's great that you're staying productive and improving yourself. If your desire to improve yourself is as strong as your desire to find a new job I'm confident you will. | seeker: It helps me to forget the past and concentrate on the future. | supporter: Don't let your past define you, let your present choices pave a new path into the future. | seeker: I am going forward only.

She is saying that she is moving out with the two kids.\n\nConversation History:\nseeker: Well, it has been a hard week. | seeker: My wife decided to separate from me with the two klids. | supporter: Whats been going on? | supporter: Oh no, that's not good | seeker: I am disgusted....just like President Donald Trump is with the $600 dollar stimulus checks. | supporter: Ain't that the truth. | seeker: It just isn't my fault. | seeker: My wife had no right to leave California without me. | seeker: I made a mistake making California my home. | supporter: I'm sure it isn't, how long had you been together? | supporter: California is beautiful I know, but it can also be pretty quick paced. | seeker: We were together 10 years. I am just disgusted that it had to happen at this point. Christmas week, of all weeks. | supporter: Are you still working? | seeker: I am still working right now. Luckily, California has plenty of money for bureacrats lie myself. | seeker: I contributed to the marriage for sure. | seeker: I love my wife and my great kids | supporter: It's important that you know that you can feel whatever way you need to about your loss. Its a tough time of year for something like that. | supporter: Had things been pretty rocky? | seeker: Things like this were sudden. I mean, I never expected her to up and walk out with the kids. | seeker: The only thing I can think of was that California was getting too expensive and the homeless were taking over LA; that may have spooked her to leave the state. | supporter: Wow, that's horrible. It seems you should have some kind of legal authority in that aspect. | supporter: Is that a big problem out there? | seeker: I really don't have any discourse. The kids are almost 18. They are twins. Yeah, in her eyes, she seems fed up with the state. She left me for Texas, the state, not the person. | seeker: I mean, she never mentioned loving, \"Text,\" but the kids are bing into the Dallas Cowboys | supporter: It is important that you understand that it seems that she has been thinking of this for a while. | seeker: I overhead her say that Texas is a free state and my twin boys do love the Dallas Cowboy's team. | supporter: Does she have family there? | seeker: Yes, she does. Both her parents live in Laredo.....big spread, too.\n\nWhat would be an appropriate counseling question to ask?\n\nCounseling Question:",
    "generated_question": "Questions: How are you feeling about the possibility of your kids moving away to Texas with her?  \nExplanation: This question is important because it addresses the emotional impact of the situation on the seeker, particularly regarding their children. The mention of the kids moving to Texas can evoke feelings of loss, concern, and anxiety about their well-being and the relationship they will have with them if they are far away. By focusing on the children, the seeker may express deeper feelings about their family dynamics and the changes that are occurring, allowing for a more supportive and empathetic conversation.",
