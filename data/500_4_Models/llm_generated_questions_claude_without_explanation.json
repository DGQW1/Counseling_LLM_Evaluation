I just need to have the ingredients. | supporter: That sounds very encouraging! It's amazing what you can make even with cheap food. Noodles , for instance, are very versatile :) | seeker: You are right. I am definitely not going to sit and pout. I am just a bit frustrated with the system. | supporter: It's a very strange situation and I suspect that some of the authorities just feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to cope. | seeker: I am concerned that my boss may try to not take me back at my job.

He assured me that they were just a pen's stroke away from being divorced. | seeker: That was in March. | seeker: I found out three weeks ago that they're actually still living together. | seeker: ANd, no. We haven't broken up yet. | supporter: Ah I totally hear you .. the old 'we're getting divorced' line. I've been in that one! You are well out of this. | seeker: I'm debating. I don't know what to do. | seeker: I feel like a schmuck. | seeker: He has such pretty words. | supporter: From personal experience I think that if they say they're going to get divorced and then drag their feet it is never going to happen. | seeker: And he invests so much time and effort into us. | seeker: I agree with you. | seeker: My mind agrees. | seeker: My stupid emotions are clouding things. | supporter: Well, if you were to give him an ultimatum what do you think he would say? | seeker: I did. | seeker: LOL | supporter: And he's still married? | seeker: And he brought his kids to my house so they could meet my kids. He had a conversation with them about why he and their mother had been living the way they had. (in seperate floors of the house) | seeker: That was two weeks ago. | seeker: So, yes, he is. | seeker: Too soon to tell. | supporter: I can tell that you feel that you are being cheated here. I can't tell you what to do but don't you think you deserve better? | seeker: I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out. Should I give him time to prove himself now that he's backed into a corner. | supporter: It's not for me to say but I wonder if he's really going to change as he has not already. | seeker: That's not an easy question to answer. He treats me very well. Always has. And he is frantically trying to accomodate me, now htat I know. | seeker: I agree with you. It's one of my fears. | supporter: How do your children feel about this? And his? | seeker: MY children (6 and 9) have been living with him in their lives as a male figure who is growing into a father figure. He and I have been together for fifteen months, and part-time living together for six. | seeker: This isn't a new relationship. That's part of the complication, too. | seeker: His kids actually asked if they could come live with me while he and his (ex?) figured their shit out. | supporter: Yes, I can imagine that it is. It is always really difficult when children are involved. I know you would not want your children to be hurt | seeker: It's a messed up situation that COVID has not improved. He was furloughed in May. | seeker: Indeed I don't, you're right. | supporter: I hear you. Covid has disrupted the whole world so might this year! I can't wait for it to be over. | seeker: But now it seems like it will hurt them if I break up with him. | supporter: But it will hurt them more the longer the situation goes on :( | seeker: I wish I could say that I were confident that 2021 would be better, but... | seeker: Too right. | seeker: And this is all a part of why this is not a simple situation. | supporter: Well it surely could not be worse :) | seeker: I have no doubt that he loves me very much. | seeker: Hahahaha! Seems that way. | seeker: He didn't make this lie up for me. That's an interesting thing. | seeker: He was living the \"divorced dad\" lie to A LOT of people. | seeker: Anybody and everybody who was far enough away to be lied to. | seeker: She lives in her bedroom. Only comes out to work two nights a week. DOesn't want to have anything to do with her kids (5, 9, 11, 13) | supporter: (sorry was afk let me catch up) | seeker: And she and my BF have been living that way for three years. Over a year before I even met him. | supporter: Is it possible she is suffering from depression? | seeker: I would all but guarantee it. | supporter: It just worries me that he might treat you the same way if you were ever in the same position | seeker: Here's the other kicker, though... | seeker: She knows about me. | seeker: (I know. You're right. I thought that as well)\n\nWhat would be an appropriate counseling question to ask?\n\nCounseling Question:",

I'm sure I'm not the only one with no plans this weekend, though. | supporter: True but I can understand that, it is hard being alone at the holidays. | supporter: Did you have plans this weekend? | seeker: No. My nearby friends all went away for the holidays. I could probably just occupy my time with things I need or want to do in order to distract myself. | supporter: What kind of hobbies do you have? | seeker: I'm teaching myself the piano. I'm also teaching myself how to work a stenography machine for possible future employment as a stenographer. I also like to read novels. | supporter: I have never understood how those work..I find it amazing someone can type out whole words or sentences with one word | seeker: Yeah, it's pretty cool. For example, if I hit DRAT in one stroke, then \"Did there come a time\" will appear in English on my machine's LCD screen. | supporter: Wow that is crazy, I don't understand how that works, is it preprogrammed or does it go by how the word sounds? | seeker: Each stenographer has their own \"Personal Dictionary\" which is a list of words in English along with how you in particular write out those words or phrases in steno. This dictionary is present within the actual steno machine after you transfer it from your laptop to the machine via cable or wifi. Thus your machine then knows how you write out words in particular and how to translate those words from steno to English - each stenographer writes a little differently. | supporter: OK that makes sense, so you basically program it as the user. I take it your stenography machine becomes pretty close to you lol | supporter: Is this your first holiday alone? | seeker: Yes, exactly! And it's very important to back up your personal dictionary to the cloud or a seperate drive so that you don't lose it in a hard-drive crash. A lot of work goes into creating that dictionary! No, it's happened before, being along for the holidays; but you've helped to cheer me up, so thanks! | supporter: No problem, I hope I have made your day a little better! | seeker: You have, thanks! Did you do anything special? | supporter: Have a good rest of this year and don't forget to make your New Year's resolution! | seeker: I will do that - you too. Thanks, again... | supporter: Not really, stayed home lol... Have a good one! | seeker: You too... bye now... | supporter: Good day!\n\nWhat would be an appropriate counseling question to ask?\n\nCounseling Question:",

Sex? | seeker: I forget what started it, it was something stupid. He didn't like the way I said something and it kind of blew up from there. | seeker: We were fighting over the smallest things these last few months. | seeker: It just kind of built up to the point where he said he couldn't take fighting with me anymore and just wanted to end it. | supporter: I would let things decompress for a long while. | seeker: End the relationship, I mean. | seeker: You think maybe if we just take some time apart, he might want to talk about it? | supporter: I suggest thinking through ending the relationship if he has a hot temper. | seeker: He does get upset very easily. | supporter: Yes, just think it through for some time. | seeker: I do think it is important to take some time and breathe. | supporter: Was the relationship with him pleasant for many months? | seeker: Yes, for most of our time together it was wonderful. | seeker: He made me laugh very easily. | seeker: That's part of why I'm so sad that he ended the relationship. | supporter: You said it has only gotten rough in the last two months? | seeker: Two or three, yes. | seeker: And we would fight over the smallest things, it was really stupid. | supporter: You said that he has announced to you he has ended the relationship on Christmas? | supporter: Today, you mean? | seeker: Yes, and it was our one year anniversary. | seeker: We were supposed to order takeout and watch a movie and exchange presents. | seeker: Instead we fought and broke up. | supporter: In my opinion, I would consider accepting that it is not going to be a healthy relationship whatsoever. | seeker: I think you are right. | seeker: Unless we went to some sort of counseling. | seeker: But it probably is for the best. | supporter: I have seen things only get worse in a situation like yours.

Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well. | seeker: Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough. | supporter: I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now? | seeker: I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot | supporter: Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that. | supporter: For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits.

I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? | seeker: I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating. | supporter: Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule. | seeker: Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school. | supporter: Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. | supporter: Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments. | seeker: Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break | seeker: I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe. | supporter: Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books. | supporter: Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing."
